    <h3>Abstract</h3> 
    <p>The transcription factor ATF2 has been shown to attenuate melanoma susceptibility to apoptosis and to promote its ability to form tumors in xenograft models. To directly assess ATF2's role in melanoma development, we crossed a mouse melanoma model (

Inhibition of MITF transcription by MITF was shown to be mediated by ATF2-JunB?dependent suppression of SOX10 transcription. Remarkably, oncogenic BRAF (V600E)?dependent focus formation of melanocytes on soft agar was inhibited by ATF2 knockdown and partially rescued upon shMITF co-expression. On melanoma tissue microarrays, a high nuclear ATF2 to MITF ratio in primary specimens was associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis. Our findings establish the importance of transcriptionally active ATF2 in melanoma development through fine-tuning of MITF expression.</p>

    <h3>Author Summary</h3> 
    <p>Understanding mechanisms underlying early stages in melanoma development is of major interest and importance. Recent studies indicate a role for MITF, a master regulator of melanocyte development and biogenesis, in melanoma progression. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor ATF2 negatively regulates MITF transcription in melanocytes and in about 50% of melanoma cell lines. Increased MITF expression, seen upon inhibition of ATF2, effectively attenuated the ability of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-expressing melanocytes to exhibit a transformed phenotype, an effect partially rescued when MITF expression was also blocked. Significantly, the development of melanoma in mice carrying genetic changes seen in human tumors was inhibited upon inactivation of ATF2 in melanocytes. Melanocytes from mice lacking active ATF2 expressed increased levels of MITF, confirming that ATF2 negatively regulates MITF and implicating this newly discovered regulatory link in melanoma development. Primary melanoma specimens that exhibit a high nuclear ATF2-to-MITF ratio were found to be associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis, further substantiating the significance of MITF control by ATF2. In all, these findings provide genetic evidence for the role of ATF2 in melanoma development and indicate an ATF2 function in fine-tuning MITF expression, which is central to understanding MITF control at the early phases of melanocyte transformation.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffcfcf">Malignant melanoma is one of the most highly invasive and metastatic tumors [1] , and its incidence has been increasing at a higher rate than other cancers in recent years [2] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd9d9">Significant advances in understanding melanoma biology have been made over the past few years, thanks to identification of genetic changes along the MAPK signaling pathway</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeded">Those include mutations in BRAF , NRAS, KIT and GNAQ, all of which result in a constitutively active MAPK pathway [3] ? [5] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffa8a8">Consequently, corresponding transcription factor targets such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) [6] , AP2 [7] , and C-JUN [8] and its heterodimeric partner ATF2 [9] are activated and induce changes in cellular growth, motility and resistance to external stress [10] , [11] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeeee">In addition, constitutively active MAPK/ERK causes rewiring of other signaling pathways [4] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe7e7">Among examples of rewired signaling is upregulation of C-JUN expression and activity [8] , which potentiates other pathways, including PDK1, AKT and PKC, and plays a critical role in melanoma development [12] </span></p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffacac">Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a member of the bZIP family, is activated by stress kinases including JNK and p38 and is implicated in transcriptional regulation of immediate early genes regulating stress and DNA damage responses [13] ? [15] and expression of cell cycle control proteins [16] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd1d1">To activate transcription, ATF2 heterodimerizes with bZIP proteins, including C-JUN and CREB [17] , [18] , both of which are constitutively upregulated in melanomas [8] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc0c0">ATF2 is also implicated in the DNA damage response through phosphorylation by ATM/ATR [19] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcaca">Knock-in mice expressing a form of ATF2 that cannot be phosphorylated by ATM are more susceptible to tumor development [20] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffecec">Nuclear localization of ATF2 in melanoma tumor cells is associated with poor prognosis [21] , likely due to transcriptional activity of constitutively active ATF2</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe4e4">Indeed, expression of transcriptionally inactive ATF2 or peptides that attenuate endogenous ATF2 activity inhibits melanoma development and progression in xenograft models [22] ? [26] </span>. <span style="background-color:#fff5f5">These studies suggest that ATF2 is required for melanoma development and progression</span>.</p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffc8c8">The transcription factor MITF has been shown to play a central role in melanocyte biology and in melanoma progression [27] , [28] </span>. <span style="background-color:#fff2f2">Yet, the role of MITF in early stages of melanoma development remains largely unexplored</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff8a8a">Factors controlling MITF transcription have been well documented and include transcriptional activators, such as SOX10, CREB, PAX3, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1, also known as TCF), onecut domain 2 (ONECUT-2) and MITF itself [29] ? [33] , as well as factors that repress MITF transcription, including BRN2 and FOXD3 [34] , [35] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeaea">In addition, MITF is subject to several post translational modifications which affect its availability and activity, including acetylation, sumoylation and ubiquitination [27] , [28] </span></p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#fff3f3">To directly assess the importance of ATF2 in melanoma development, we employed a mouse melanoma model in which ATF2 is selectively inactivated in melanocytes</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff3f3">We demonstrate that melanoma development is markedly attenuated in mice expressing a transcriptionally inactive form of ATF2 in melanocytes</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe4e4">Surprisingly, ATF2 control of melanoma development was mediated, in part, through its negative regulation of SOX10 and consequently of MITF transcription</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff7f7">Inhibition of ATF2 abolished mutant BRAF-expressing melanocytes' ability to form foci on soft agar, which was partially rescued when expression of MITF was attenuated</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe6e6">The significance of these findings is underscored by our observation of human melanoma tumors, in which high ratio of nuclear ATF2 to MITF expression was associated with poor prognosis</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff8f8">These findings identify a novel mechanism underlying melanocyte transformation and melanoma development</span>.</p>

   <h3>MITF transcription is negatively regulated by ATF2 in about 50% of human melanoma cells</h3> 
   <p><span style="background-color:#ff9d9d">Given that ATF2 negatively regulates MITF in melanocytes of mouse and human tissues and in related melanocyte cell lines, we asked whether ATF2 also regulates MITF in human melanoma cells</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffb4b4">Initially, we assessed changes in MITF expression in six human melanoma lines harboring oncogenic mutations in BRAF or NRAS , and in which ATF2 expression was effectively inhibited by corresponding shRNA (shATF2)</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe6e6">In all cases, shRNA specificity was confirmed using three independent sequences (data not shown)</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff8585">Surprisingly, the six melanoma lines fell into two classes based on distinct patterns of regulation of MITF by ATF2 ( Table 4 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff6464">The first class comprised four of the six melanoma cultures (1205Lu, WM35, WM793 and WM1361), in which MITF expression was elevated 3?6-fold following inhibition of ATF2 expression ( Figure 3c , S2a )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff4545">Conversely, a second class of cells, including MeWo and 501Mel cells, exhibited decreased MITF expression after ATF2 knockdown (KD), suggesting positive regulation of MITF by ATF2 ( Figure 3d , S2b )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd5d5">Notably, this latter group showed high levels of basal MITF expression [41] , [42] , suggesting that regulation of MITF expression in these cells differs mechanistically from that of the first group</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff5454">Further, in response to stress (UV or hypoxia) the MeWo and 501Mel lines further reduced MITF expression ( Figure 3d and data not shown), providing further evidence for differential regulation of MITF in these cells both prior to and in response to stress stimuli</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffa4a4">Additional analyses were performed, employing 12 more melanoma cell lines</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcfcf">Inhibition of ATF2 expression revealed that 4/12 exhibited increase in MITF expression, while 6/12 decreased MITF expression</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff0000">Two of the 12 lines did not exhibit change in MITF expression following ATF2 KD ( Table 4 , S5)</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc5c5">Collectively, out of 18 melanoma lines we found that 8 (44%) retained similar negative regulation of MITF by ATF2 as observed in the melanocytes</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffecec">However, another 8 (44%) exhibited positive regulation of MITF by ATF2, pointing to a transcriptional switch that occurred in the course of melanocyte transformation</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff6464">MITF was not affected by altered ATF2 expression in 2/18 cell lines ( Table 4 , Figure S5 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcaca">In all, in about 50% of the melanoma cell lines ATF2 elicits negative regulation of MITF, similar to what was seen in human and mouse melanocytes</span>.</p>

   <p><span style="background-color:#ffd5d5">A putative response element for AP1 (which can serve as an ATF2 response element through ATF2 heterodimerization with JUN family members; [9] ) has been identified in upstream regions of the Sox10 promoter [44] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc0c0">We examined potential ATF2 binding to this element by ChIP and found that endogenous ATF2, but not ATFa, binds to that AP1 sequence (?4797?4791) in both human melanocytes and melanoma cells ( Figure 5b )</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff1f1">We next set to identify ATF2 heterodimeric partner, which could mediate negative regulation of SOX10 transcription</span>. <span style="background-color:#fffcfc">Among members of the JUN family implicated in transcriptional silencing is JunB</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe6e6">Thus, further assessment was performed to determine if JunB functions as an ATF2 heterodimerization partner to regulate SOX10 transcription through the AP1 site</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe3e3">ChIP analysis confirmed that JunB binds to the AP1 site found in SOX10 promoter sequences ( Figure 5c )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeded">To confirm a possible role for JunB in regulating MITF transcription we asked whether expression of TAM67, a negative regulator of Jun family members, could attenuate the binding and transcriptional activities elicited by JunB</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">Expression of TAM67 indeed reduced the degree of ATF2 and JunB binding to the AP1 site on SOX10 promoter</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcdcd">Further, KD of ATF2 expression abolished binding of both ATF2 and JunB to the AP1 site on the SOX10 promoter ( Figure 5c )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd9d9">These data confirm the presence of ATF2-JunB complex on Sox10 promoter and suggest that ATF2 recruits JunB for binding to the AP1 site on SOX10 promoter</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffa3a3">To assess the role of JunB on SOX10 transcription we have monitored changes in Sox10 expression at the protein and RNA levels</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe1e1">Expression of TAM67 caused increased expression of SOX10 in both human melanoma (?2 folds; Figure 5d ) and melanocytes (?3 folds; Figure 5e ), indicating some relief of JunB inhibition</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff8a8a">Co-expression of TAM67 with Jun B attenuated this increase, reducing the level of Sox10 expression to basal levels ( Figure 5d, 5e )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc1c1">Over-expression of JunB, but not Jun D, effectively inhibited Sox10 expression in both the melanoma and melanocytes cells ( Figure 5d, 5e )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdede">These data suggest that JunB mediates inhibition of Sox10 expression</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe8e8">To further reveal the role of ATF2 in this inhibition, we assessed the effect of JunB on Sox10 expression in cells expressing control shRNA or shATF2</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffa4a4">While ectopic expression of JunB reduced the expression of Sox10 in control shRNA-expressing cells, such decrease was no longer seen in cells expressing shATF2 ( Figure 5f )</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">Collectively, these findings suggest that ATF2, in concert with JunB, is responsible for inhibition of Sox10 expression</span>.</p> 
   <p><span style="background-color:#ffd5d5">We next assessed the effect of ATF2 on SOX10 and MITF expression in 12 additional human melanoma cell lines</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff8888">In all cases cells were infected with shATF2 and changes in SOX10 and MITF were monitored at the level of RNA</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff0a0a">Notably, about 4/12 melanoma lines revealed increase in both SOX10 and MITF expression upon KD of ATF2 ( Figure S5 , Table 4 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff4d4d">In contrast, 6/12 melanoma lines revealed decrease in MITF expression, of which 5 also shown decrease in SOX10 expression, pointing to positive regulation of SOX10 and MITF in these melanoma cells</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffb9b9">In two out of the 12 melanoma lines ATF2 affected SOX10 but not MITF transcription ( Figure S5 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff5c5c">Overall, our cohort of 18 melanoma lines revealed that about 50% of the melanomas retained negative regulation of MITF by ATF2, as seen in the melanocytes (primary and cell lines) ( Table 4 )</span></p> 
   <p><span style="background-color:#ffd2d2">To further assess whether ATF2 regulation of MITF is SOX10-dependent in melanocytes and melanoma cells, we coexpressed SOX10 in shATF2-expressing cells</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff0000">As seen in earlier analysis, inhibition of ATF2 expression caused increase in MITF transcription in the human melanocytes and 4 melanoma cell lines, (WM1361, WM793, LU1205, WM35; Figure S6 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff8f8f">Notably, the melanocytes and 2/4 melanoma cell lines revealed ATF2 effect on MITF expression is SOX10-dependent (WM1361, WM793; Figure S6 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff4f4f">Two of the four melanoma cell lines did not reveal increased SOX10 expression, although they retained increased MITF expression, upon inhibition of ATF2 (Lu1205, WM35; Figure S6 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd6d6">These findings confirm that while in melanocytes, expression of SOX10 and MITF is negatively regulated by ATF2, this mechanism is conserved in approximately half of melanomas surveyed</span>.</p> 
   <p><span style="background-color:#ffa4a4">Along these lines, the two melanoma lines (MeWo and 501 Mel) that exhibit positive regulation of MITF by ATF2 also exhibited positive regulation of SOX10 by ATF2 ( Figure S7 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffb7b7">Inhibition of ATF2 expression reduced SOX10 and MITF RNA and protein levels ( Figure S7a?c )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffb9b9">In order to determine whether JunB lost its ability to elicit negative regulation of SOX10 and MITF in melanoma cells where ATF2 no longer inhibited SOX10 or MITF expression, we transfected those cell lines with TAM67 and JunB alone and in combination</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc1c1">In these cells, whereas TAM67 effectively attenuated Sox10 and MITF expression, JunB did not alter expression of these genes, suggesting that positive regulation of MITF and SOX10 by ATF2 depends on other members of the Jun family of transcription factors ( Figure S7d )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdcdc">Conversely, TAM67 or JunB had no effect on melanoma cells in which ATF2 inhibits MITF independently of SOX10, suggesting that in these cases, ATF2 likely cooperates with transcription factors other than JunB to elicit negative regulation of SOX10 and MITF ( Figure S7d )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd0d0">Consistent with this observation, ChIP assay confirmed ATF2 and CREB, but not JunB, binding to the Sox10 promoter in these cells ( Figure S7e )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffb3b3">These findings suggest that changes in ATF2 heterodimeric partner (from JunB to CREB) are likely to cause the switch from negative to positive regulation of SOX10, and in turn, MITF (see below)</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdfdf">The possibility that altered expression of JunB may account for ATF2 positive or negative regulation of Sox10 and MITF were excluded, as no clear correlation between JunB expression and the ability of ATF2 to elicit negative regulation of Sox10/MITF were seen ( Figure S7f )</span></p> 
   <p><span style="background-color:#ffeaea">Among response elements potentially required to upregulate MITF transcription is the CRE element, which is implicated in CREB-mediated upregulation of MITF transcription [45] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcaca">Although transcriptional activity from a CRE mutant MITF promoter was lower compared to the WT promoter (30%), it was no longer responsive to inhibition of ATF2 expression in the MeWo cells ( Figure S8a )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffb8b8">Pull-down assays using biotin-tagged MITF promoter sequences harboring the CRE identified ATF2 and CREB as CRE-bound proteins in MeWo melanoma cells ( Figure S8b )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdbdb">In agreement, ChIP analysis confirmed occupancy of the CRE site on MITF promoter by ATF2 ( Figure S8c )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcece">These findings are consistent with the fact that ATF2 heterodimerizes with CREB [9] and with a report that p38/MAPK14 (which phosphorylates ATF2) plays an important role in MITF transcription dependent on the CRE site [46] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeaea">These results establish that ATF2-dependent activation of MITF transcription in these melanoma cells is mediated through the CRE site, likely in cooperation with CREB</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff3f3f">Notably, MeWo and 501Mel lines are known to express high MITF levels compared to other melanoma lines [41] , [42] , suggesting these cells harbor distinct mechanisms that preclude negative regulation of MITF by ATF2</span></p>

  <h3>Discussion</h3> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffeaea">Identifying mechanisms underlying early phases of melanocyte transformation and melanoma development is central to understanding the etiology of this devastating tumor, as well as for developing novel treatment approaches</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe2e2">Previous studies indicate the presence of mutant BRAF in melanocytic lesions, as well as its effect on pigment gene expression [6] , [50] , [51] </span>. <span style="background-color:#fff8f8">The present study enhances our understanding of early events contributing to melanoma development</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeaea">We demonstrate that loss of a transcriptionally active form of ATF2 in melanocytes inhibits melanoma development in an Nras/Ink4a model</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe0e0">Our quest to understand mechanisms underlying ATF2 activity in this process led us to identify an important role for ATF2 regulation of MITF, an important regulator of melanocyte biogenesis and a factor implicated in melanoma progression [49] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffecec">Surprisingly, ATF2 negatively regulated MITF expression in mouse and human melanocytes, suggesting that ATF2 transcriptional activities limit MITF expression</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe6e6">We demonstrate that such negative regulation is elicited through downregulation of SOX10 by ATF2, in cooperation with JunB</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdddd">A putative AP1 response element has been identified in SOX10 promoter sequences and ChIP analysis of this domain showed ATF2 and JunB binding</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe4e4">Overexpression of JunB efficiently suppressed SOX10 expression in an ATF2-dependent manner and inhibition of Jun transcriptional activities phenocopied the effect of shATF2, suggesting that negative regulation of SOX10 by ATF2 is direct, and is mediated in cooperation with JunB</span>.</p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffb9b9">Importantly, ATF2-dependent negative regulation of Sox10 and consequently of MITF seen in melanocytes, but only in about 50% of the 18 melanoma cell lines studied here</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe5e5">Correspondingly, JunB, which is required for ATF2-dependent inhibition of Sox10 transcription, is no longer found on the promoter of SOX10 in melanoma cells (i.e</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff6f6">501Mel) that exhibit positive regulation by ATF2</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd1d1">Rather, CREB and ATF2 are found on SOX10 and MITF promoters, pointing to a switch in ATF2 heterodimeric partners to enable positive regulation of these genes</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff5050">Notably, melanoma cell lines that exhibit positive regulation of SOX10 and MITF by ATF2, also show high basal levels of MITF expression [41] , [42] , suggesting that additional genetic or epigenetic changes distinguish these lines from melanocytes and the other melanoma lines in which ATF2 elicits negative regulation of MITF</span></p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffe2e2">Notably, ATF2 control of MITF expression affected the ability of BRAF600E-expressing melanocytes to exhibit transformed phenotype in culture, monitored by their ability to grow on soft agar</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff9f9f">Inhibition of ATF2 abolished soft agar growth of BRAF600E-expressing melanocytes, which was partially rescued upon KD of MITF</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcaca">Interestingly, both the over expression or the KD of MITF resulted in inhibition of melanocytes ability to grow on soft agar, substantiating the notion that a fine balance of MITF expression must be maintained in order to ensure its contribution to cellular proliferation and transformation</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe0e0">We propose that excessively low or high MITF levels block melanocyte transformation, whereas intermediate levels allow transformation to occur</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc9c9">Overall, our observations demonstrate that ATF2 plays an important role in fine-tuning those levels and support the rheostat model proposed for MITF's role in melanoma development and progression [48] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffecec">Of importance, ATF2 and MITF affect the ability of BRAF600E-expressing melanocytes to grow on soft agar via distinct mechanisms</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffbcbc">Whereas specific inhibition of ATF2 causes both accumulation of cells in G2 and induction of cell death, specific alteration of MITF protein levels?particularly depletion?significantly affects cell proliferation and inhibit growth on soft agar by non-lethally slowing cell cycle progression at G2/M</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe1e1">These observations are consistent with a report from Wellbrock and Marais [52] , who showed that altered MITF expression inhibits melanocyte proliferation</span></p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ffcaca">Importantly, inhibiting MITF expression in ATF2 KD melanocytes was sufficient to partially rescue melanocyte growth on soft agar</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc3c3">While supportive of our finding in the Nras::Ink4a mouse melanoma model, where expression of transcriptionally inactive ATF2 inhibits melanoma formation, these observations provide the foundation for a model in which ATF2 inhibition causes increased MITF levels and concomitant inhibition of melanocyte growth, possible induction of cell death and delayed development</span>. <span style="background-color:#ff9d9d">The latter is suggested by IHC analysis of mouse skin from ATF2 md mice, which shows notably reduced S100 staining indicative of delayed melanocyte development: ATF2 KO melanocytes appear to represent anagen stage IV, whereas WT represent anagen stage VI</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcccc">This delay was seen at the 4- but not the 14-day time point, suggesting that an ATF2 effect might be limited to a specific subpopulation or phase of melanocyte development</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffe0e0">The early (4 day) time point is within the time frame that allows induction of melanoma development by UV-irradiation of c-Met or H-Ras mutant mice [53] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeded">It is therefore plausible that timely control of MITF expression by ATF2 determines melanocyte susceptibility to transformation</span>.</p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#ff9f9f">Our analysis of genes whose expression is altered by ATF2 KD in melanocytes identified a cluster of pigmentation genes, many reportedly regulated by MITF [6] , [54] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdbdb">Therefore, changes in TYRP1, DCT and SILVER expression could be attributed to altered MITF expression</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffc2c2">However, initial analysis points to a more complex mechanism since (i) the degree of changes in expression of these genes was often greater than that seen for MITF and (ii) expression of some pigmentation genes was found to be independent of MITF in some melanoma and melanocyte cultures</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdada">Hence, further studies are required to address mechanisms underlying ATF2 regulation of these pigmentation genes and the significance of such regulation to melanocyte transformation and melanoma development</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffebeb">While our present studies focused on the ATF2-MITF axis, it is expected that additional ATF2-regulated genes contribute to melanoma development [12] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcfcf">In agreement, our earlier studies using both human and mouse melanoma lines demonstrate that inhibition of ATF2 effectively inhibits tumorigenesis and blocks metastasis [22] ?

  <p><span style="background-color:#fffdfd">Important for ATF2 function is its subcellular localization</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd9d9">While findings presented here position ATF2 as an oncogene functioning in melanocyte transformation and melanoma development, earlier studies from our laboratory and others suggest that in keratinocytes and mammary glands, ATF2 elicits a tumor suppressor function [55] , [56] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd0d0">Of interest, assessing the localization of ATF2 in the melanoma cell lines studied here revealed that all express nuclear ATF2</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd3d3">Interestingly, in most cases the nuclear staining revealed a punctate staining, resembling the localization of ATF2 to DNA repair foci following DNA damage ( Figure S9 )</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffecec">A possible link between the presence of ATF2 in repair foci in most melanoma cells points to the possible presence of activated DNA damage response which may be associated with genomic instability [19] , [20] ?aspects that will be explored in future studies</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff3f3">Significantly, the appearance of nuclear ATF2 is correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma, whereas melanomas that exhibit cytosolic ATF2 exhibit a better survival</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeded">Notably, cytosolic ATF2 is primarily seen in non-malignant skin tumors [55] </span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcdcd">Here we demonstrate that high nuclear ATF2/MITF ratios are associated with poor prognosis in primary melanomas, but not with metastatic melanomas</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffeeee">The latter finding attests for the important role ATF2 plays to control MITF expression in the early phase of melanocyte transformation and melanoma development</span>.</p> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#fff5f5">Overall, using the mutant Nras / Ink4a melanoma model we provide genetic evidence for a central role for ATF2 in melanoma development</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff3f3">We demonstrate that in the absence of transcriptionally active ATF2, melanoma formation is largely inhibited</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffdfdf">Furthermore, our data point to an unexpected role of ATF2 in fine-tuning of MITF transcription through regulation of its positive regulator SOX10</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff5f5">Mouse melanoma models and in vitro transformation studies indicate that this newly identified regulatory pathway is required for early phases of melanocyte transformation</span>. <span style="background-color:#fff8f8">Given that ATF2 affects activity of the oncogenes N-Ras (mouse model) and BRAF (melanocyte growth on soft agar); we expect that ATF2 play significant roles in melanomas that carry either of these mutations</span></p>
