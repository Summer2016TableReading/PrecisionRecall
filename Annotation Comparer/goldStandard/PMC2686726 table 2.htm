tailored to a patient's genetic composition will be of tremendous value for
treatment of cancer. Recently, Kirsten <i>ras </i>(KRAS) status has emerged as
a predictor of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted
therapies. In this article, we will discuss targeted therapies for colorectal
cancers (CRC) based on EGFR signaling pathway and review published data about
the potential usefulness of KRAS as a biological marker for response to these
therapies. Results from relevant studies published since 2005 and unpublished
results presented at national meetings were retrieved and summarized. These
studies reflected response (or lack of response) to EGFR-targeted therapies in
patients with metastatic CRC as a function of KRAS status. It has become clear
that patients with colorectal cancer whose tumor has an activating mutation in
KRAS do not respond to monoclonal antibody therapies targeting EGFR. It should
now become a standard practice that any patients being considered for EGFR
targeted therapies have their tumors tested for KRAS status and only those with
wild-type KRAS being offered such therapies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Over the past decade, we have
witnessed an important development in the field of cancer treatment: therapy
that is targeted to specific pathways involved in tumor growth and progression.
This mechanistic, target-based approach is adding to the treatment options for
cancer, and these treatments should be less toxic to normal cells and thus
improve the therapeutic index.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>To date, however, the overall
effectiveness of targeted therapy in solid tumors has not been as robust as
that achieved, for example, by Gleevec (imatinib) in the treatment of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML). The difference in targeted therapy effectiveness in
CML compared with solid tumors can be explained in part by the genetic etiology
of the diseases. CML is caused by a single genetic alteration that results in a
<i>BCR/ABL </i>fusion gene. This gene produces a chimeric protein with strong
tyrosine kinase activity that can be effectively blocked by Gleevec. For most
solid tumors, on the other hand, although they may appear to be morphologically
similar on microscopic examination, molecular studies can identify different
genetic alterations in tumors from different patients. Due to this
heterogeneity, an agent targeting one particular pathway is unlikely to be
effective in all patients. Clearly, there is a need to identify those patients
who are most likely to respond to a specific therapy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The identification of specific
subgroups of patients who may benefit from a particular targeted therapy has
been most successful in patients with breast cancer. Anti-estrogen treatment,
an early type of targeted therapy, mainly benefits patients with estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab, a HER2-targeting monoclonal
antibody, is most beneficial in patients with tumors that overexpress HER2.
Recent data also suggest that genetic profiling can predict which patients may
benefit from adjuvant therapy after resection of their breast cancers (e.g.,
Genomic Health's Oncotype DX<sup>� </sup>test, which profiles the expression of
21 genes and makes a prediction about the likelihood of disease recurrence).
These findings show great promise for identifying patients eligible for
treatment with specific targeted therapies, as well as for making decisions
about dosage and length of treatment.</span></p>

tailored to a patient's genetic composition and tests that can predict which
therapy he/she will respond to will be of tremendous value for colorectal
carcinoma (CRC). Despite significant progress in the development of new
therapies over the last decade, CRC remains one of the top three causes of
cancer death in the United States, where it is estimated that 148,810 patients
will be newly diagnosed with CRC in 2008, with 49,960 deaths from this disease

of these patients will receive one or more lines of chemotherapy, but not
everyone responds to each regimen. For example, the targeted agent cetuximab as
a single agent has a response rate of only about 10% in patients with
irinotecan-refractory CRC [</span><a

words, the majority of people receiving cetuximab may not benefit from it,
while incurring all the associated cost and toxicities. Considering the large
number of cases of CRC, this translates into millions of dollars spent and
significant toxicities experienced with no benefit.</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>EGFR is a member of the HER
(ErbB) family of human epidermal growth factor receptors that can promote tumor
cell proliferation in a variety of epithelial malignancies. The EGFR molecules
are 170 kd transmembrane glycoproteins: the extracellular domain has the ligand
binding site and also contains specific sequences that are involved in
dimerization, while the intracellular domain is a catalytic site that has
tyrosine kinase activity. EGFR binds soluble ligands, including epidermal
growth factors (EGFs) and transforming growth factor-alpha, and the
ligand/receptor complex then signals the formation of receptor dimers (either
homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the HER family). Dimerization
triggers an intracellular phosphorylation cascade that transmits the original
ligand-generated signal from the cell surface to the nucleus, causing
downstream changes in gene expression that affect cell proliferation,
migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Overexpression of EGFR has been
detected in many human cancers, including CRC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

EGFR can be effective as anticancer therapy in several ways. They can block
ligand binding to the receptor, aborting the process of dimerization and
phosphorylation that allows downstream signal transduction. In some cases, the
antibody/receptor complex may also be immunogenic, leading to
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</span></p>

mechanism of action, but this has not been documented. Cetuximab has been
demonstrated to improve response rate, time to progression, and overall

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>KRAS encodes a
membrane-associated GTPase that is an early player in many signal transduction
pathways. KRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch for the recruitment and
activation of proteins necessary for the propagation of growth factor and other
receptor signals, such as c-Raf and PI 3-kinase. When activated, KRAS is
involved in the dephosphorylation of GTP to GDP, after which it is turned off.
The rate of GTP to GDP conversion can be sped up dramatically by an accessory
protein of the Guanine nucleotide activating protein (GAP) class, for example
RasGAP. KRAS can also facilitate the release of bound nucleotide by binding to
proteins of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) class, for example
Soverall survival-1. HRAS is subsequently released from the GEF and quickly
re-binds to the now available GTP resulting in HRAS activation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>When EGF ligand binds to the
extracellular part of the EGFR receptor, the receptor dimerizes and its
enzymatic activity is activated, resulting in phosphorylation of the
intracellular domain. Subsequently, cellular effectors bind to phosphorylated
residues of the intracellular domain and are activated, mainly through
relocalization to the plasma membrane. When an activating mutation occurs in
the KRAS gene, the RAS G-protein activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling cascade downstream of EGFR. This may bypass the need for ligand
binding to EGFR, conferring resistance to therapies like cetuximab or
panitumumab which target the EGFR extracellularly.</span></p>

treated metastatic CRC were treated with cetuximab plus either irinotecan- or

tumor samples, the investigators detected a KRAS mutation in 16 out of 59 (27%)

stable disease. No KRAS mutation was found in the 12 patients with a complete

detectable KRAS mutations, using two sensitive methods able to specifically
detect KRAS exon 2 mutations: a multiplex SNaPshot assay based on primer
extension able to detect the different KRAS mutations simultaneously in a
single tube, and a fluorescent PCR-LCR assay. These two analyses were performed
on samples from 11 out of 12 patients with either complete response or partial
response, in 15 out of 16 patients with stable disease, and in 15 patients with
disease progression, all of whom had no mutations revealed by direct sequencing
of tumor DNA. Five additional KRAS mutations were detected by both methods and
one mutation was detected only by PCR-LCR assay. These six additional mutations
were found in two patients with stable disease and four patients with disease
progression. SNaPshot and PCR-LCR assays confirmed the absence of KRAS
mutations in the CR/PR patients. Therefore, in this series of 59 patients with metastatic
CRC, sequencing analysis supplemented by SNaPshot multiplex and PCR-LCR assays

reduced response in mutant KRAS tumors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Although patients originally
selected for randomization had a 0/1 skin reaction after 22 days of standard
treatment, with continued treatment some patients developed a more severe
cutaneous response to the medication. Skin reaction predicted clinical outcomes
in patients with both KRAS WT and KRAS MT tumors, with a grade 2/3 reaction
associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with a grade
1/2 reaction in each group. However, the overall range of PFS values was
significantly higher in the KRAS WT group; at 200 days, the average PFS
associated with a Grade 2/3 reaction was 60% in the wild-type KRAS group
compared with approximately 34% in the mutant KRAS group. The ability of skin
reaction to distinguish subgroups of KRAS WT or MT patients with differing
outcomes argues that skin reaction and KRAS status are independent predictors
of response to cetuximab-based treatment.</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Recent developments in
individualized therapies for CRC are having a significant impact on current
clinical practice and on the future development of treatments for this disease.
To date, clinical activity has been assessed in over 2500 patients treated with
cetuximab/panitumumab, either as a single agent or in combination with both
FOFIRI and FOLOX chemotherapy, in both chemotherapy-refractory and
chemotherapy-na�ve settings. There is strong evidence that mutated KRAS in
tumors predicts unresponsiveness to EGFR-targeted antibody therapies.
Furthermore, data from the CRYSTAL, OPUS, and CAIRO2 studies showed evidence
that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy (both oxaliplatin- and
irinotecan-based) may have detrimental effects on patients with KRAS MT tumors.
It is therefore important to test KRAS status in tumors of all patients being
considered for EGFR-targeted antibody therapies, and only those patients with
KRAS WT tumors should receive such treatments. Randomized prospective trials
are not needed nor are they ethical to prove this concept further. In fact, the
European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved panitumumab only for patients with
KRAS wild-type tumors. It is likely that verification of KRAS wild-type status
will be required by the United States Food and Drug Administrative (US FDA) for
cetuximab and panitumumab treatment in the near future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Several commercial DNA
sequencing-based KRAS tests for tumor tissues are available. Developing and
validating more sensitive, reproducible, and affordable KRAS tests that can be
used in the clinic is an important task that industry and government should
undertake in order to maximize the value of this biomarker for individualized
therapies in CRC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Moving forward, there are several
issues, both immediate and long term, that need to be addressed:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Modification of
current and future trial designs</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>At least two large randomized
phase III trials in the U.S. need to be modified. The CALGB/SWOG 80405 study
compares bevacizumab and cetuximab either alone or together in combination with
FOLFIRI or FOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic CRC. This
study, initially designed to enroll 2289 patients, has already accrued about 1400
patients. While the modification plan is still being formulated, it is almost
certain that KRAS testing will be required and only patients with wild-type
KRAS would be allowed for randomization. A second study, the iBET trial, which
was developed based on the BRiTE data, tests whether continuing bevacizumab
beyond progression on first line therapy would be beneficial. However, as
second line therapy, while patients are randomized to study arms with or
without bevacizumab, all patients receive cetuximab. This was probably a
forward-thinking design when it was conceived, because the EPIC study showed
activity of cetuximab in second line therapy for irinotecan-na�ve patients.
With more convincing KRAS data, it undoubtedly requires modification. One
option would be to completely drop the cetuximab component and to only test the
question of whether continuation of bevacizumab beyond progression on first
line therapy is beneficial. However, if cetuximab is to be continued as a
component in this trial, KRAS testing should be required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In addition, given the clear
predictive value of KRAS status, all future trials involving EGFR-targeted
monoclonal antibodies should incorporate KRAS testing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The EGFR monoclonal antibodies
target the extracellular domain of the receptor. Therefore, tumors with KRAS
mutations that confer constitutive activation of intracellular downstream
pathways may not respond to these monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies. This
may not apply to small molecule inhibitors that specifically target the
intracellular downstream protein kinases. At present, small molecule inhibitors
have not shown significant benefit in CRCs. However, when more potent agents of
this type are developed, they will need to be determined whether their efficacy
is influenced by the presence of KRAS mutations in the tumor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The emerging KRAS data leaves
open the question of what to do for patients with KRAS mutant tumors. As EGFR
monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies are being taken away, these patients are
left with only two lines of therapy, either FOLFOX or FOLIRI along with
bevacizumab. There is a pressing need to develop novel therapies for this group
of patients. Future trials with novel biologically rational agents should be
developed for these patients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>While data clearly indicate that
KRAS MT predicts unresponsiveness to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody
therapies, KRAS WT does not necessarily predict response: the median response
rate of wild-type KRAS tumors in the studies reviewed here was only 35%.
Obviously, other markers or combinations of markers that better predict
response to a chosen treatment are urgently needed. Markers currently under
study include EGFR copy number, EGFR ligands, microsatellite instability (MSI),
PTEN, PI3K, and others. However more data will be needed to incorporate these
and other novel markers into clinical practice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>We have made significant progress
in the management of CRC, and to some degree, we have been successful in
converting metastatic CRC to a chronic disease state. Targeted therapy, which
has been the hot topic for the past decade, now plays a key role in the
treatment of CRCs. How to use available agents to maximize the benefit and
minimize the associated cost and toxicity is a critical question. Undoubtedly,
the future of oncology lies in individualized treatment based on each person's
genetic composition. To this end, we have taken a huge step forward with KRAS,
and within the next decade, it is likely that we will see more and more
biomarkers come into clinical practice to direct individualized treatment.</span></p>
