    <h3>Abstract</h3> 
    <sec> 
     <h3>Background</h3> 
     <p>Parathyroid adenomas constitute the most common entity in primary hyperparathyroidism, and although recent advances have been made regarding the underlying genetic cause of these lesions, very little data on epigenetic alterations in this tumour type exists. In this study, we have determined the levels of promoter methylation regarding the four tumour suppressor genes

       <sup>INK4A</sup> 
      </italic> and 
      <italic>
        RAR-? 
      </italic> in parathyroid adenomas. In addition, the levels of global methylation were assessed by analyzing 
      <italic>
        LINE-1 
      </italic> repeats.</p> 
    </sec> 
    <sec> 
     <h3>Methodology/Principal Findings</h3> 
     <p>The sample collection consisted of 55 parathyroid tumours with known 
      <italic>
        HRPT2 
      </italic> and/or 
      <italic>
        MEN1 
      </italic> genotypes. Using Pyrosequencing analysis, we demonstrate 
      <italic>
        APC 
      </italic> promoter 1A and 
      <italic>
        RASSF1A 
      </italic> promoter hypermethylation in the majority of parathyroid tumours (71% and 98%, respectively). Using TaqMan qRT-PCR, all tumours analyzed displayed lower 
      <italic>
        RASSF1A 
      </italic> mRNA expression and higher levels of total 
      <italic>
        APC 
      </italic> mRNA than normal parathyroid, the latter of which was largely conferred by augmented 
      <italic>
        APC 1B 
      </italic> transcription levels. Hypermethylation of 
      <italic>
        p16 
       <sup>INK4A</sup> 
      </italic> was demonstrated in a single adenoma, whereas 
      <italic>
        RAR-? 
      </italic> hypermethylation was not observed in any sample. Moreover, based on 
      <italic>
        LINE-1 
      </italic> analyses, parathyroid tumours exhibited global methylation levels within the range of non-neoplastic parathyroid tissues.</p> 
    </sec> 
    <sec> 
     <h3>Conclusions/Significance</h3> 
     <p>The results demonstrate that 
      <italic>
        APC 
      </italic> and 
      <italic>
        RASSF1A 
      </italic> promoter hypermethylation are common events in parathyroid tumours. While 
      <italic>
        RASSF1A 
      </italic> mRNA levels were found downregulated in all tumours investigated, 
      <italic>
        APC 
      </italic> gene expression was retained through 
      <italic>
        APC 1B 
      </italic> mRNA levels. These findings suggest the involvement of the Ras signaling pathway in parathyroid tumorigenesis. Additionally, in contrast to most other human cancers, parathyroid tumours were not characterized by global hypomethylation, as parathyroid tumours exhibited 
      <italic>
        LINE-1 
      </italic> methylation levels similar to that of normal parathyroid tissues.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3> 
  <p>Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder which denotes the tumorous enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands. While the genetic background of PHPT has been partly elucidated, the involvement of epigenetic modifications remains unresolved. Mutations in the 
   <italic>
     HRPT2 
   </italic> (also known as 
   <italic>
     CDC73 
   </italic>) and 
   <italic>
     MEN1 
   </italic> tumour suppressor genes are two important genetic events propelling parathyroid tumorigenesis

   </xref>–

     [3] 
   </xref>. The protein product of 
   <italic>
     HRPT2 
   </italic> is parafibromin, which is functionally linked to the canonical part of the Wingless type (Wnt) pathway 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Mosimann1">
     [4] 
   </xref>. Parafibromin is a part of the human polymerase associated factor complex (hPAF) which is required for facilitating transcription elongation and histone modifications

     [5] 
   </xref>– 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Yart1">
     [6] 
   </xref>. Furthermore, parafibromin has been shown to associate with the Wnt oncoprotein ?-catenin and to down-regulate c-Myc oncogene transcription through direct binding to the c-Myc promoter region, supporting the role of parafibromin as a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits Wnt signaling 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Lin1">
     [7] 
   </xref>. Interestingly, the 
   <italic>

  <p>To broaden the knowledge of epigenetic events in parathyroid tumour development, we sought to determine the levels of promoter methylation of four tumour suppressor genes;

  <h3>Discussion</h3> 
  <p>In this study we demonstrate frequent hypermethylation of the 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> and 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> tumour suppressor genes in the majority of parathyroid adenomas. 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> promoter hypermethylation led to diminished 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> mRNA levels in parathyroid adenomas as compared to normal parathyroid tissues, whereas 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> gene expression is retained through augmented expression of 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> 1B mRNA regulated by 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1B. In addition, based on 
   <italic>
     LINE-1 
   </italic> promoter methylation results parathyroid benign tumours were found to exhibit global methylation levels within range of the normal parathyroid tissues examined.</p> 
  <p> 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> gene expression is regulated by at least two separate promoter regions, named 1A and 1B. Hypermethylation of promoter 1A has been readily demonstrated in various human tumours; however to our knowledge there is no or little evidence suggesting epigenetic inactivation of the 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1B through hypermethylation 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Segditsas1">
     [33] 
   </xref>. Hence, for this purpose we focused solely on the 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1A regarding Pyrosequencing analyses. In our tumour panel, hypermethylation of the 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1A was found in the majority of benign parathyroid tumours, as well as in one familial 
   <italic>
     HRPT2 
   </italic> related case. These results are supported by research in colorectal tumorigenesis, where promoter 1A methylation is regarded as an early event and is readily detected in small colorectal adenomas 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Segditsas1">
     [33] 
   </xref>. Furthermore, in this study all 16 adenomas analyzed by qRT-PCR displayed augmented 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> 1B mRNA levels as compared to normal parathyroid tissues, strongly suggesting that the 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1B is not epigenetically silenced in these tumours.</p> 
  <p>Parafibromin, encoded by 
   <italic>
     HRPT2 
   </italic>, is a vital part of the hPAF complex involved in epigenetic modifications for facilitating gene transcription, and has also been shown to specifically regulate 
   <italic>
     c-Myc 
   </italic> oncogene expression through binding directly to the 
   <italic>
     c-Myc 
   </italic> promoter region 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Lin1">
     [7] 
   </xref>. Our results do not point towards a specific correlation between 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter methylation and 
   <italic>
     HRPT2 
   </italic> gene mutations, suggesting that parafibromin may not play an apparent role in the regulation of 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1A methylation. However, 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter 1A methylation displayed a weak but significant correlation to the tumour suppressor 
   <italic>
     MEN1 
   </italic> genotype, and all parathyroid tumours with 
   <italic>
     MEN1 
   </italic> mutations in our panel displayed 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> hypermethylation ranging from 11.6–65.9% ( 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009472-g002">
     Figure 2 
   </xref>). Interestingly, the 
   <italic>
     MEN1 
   </italic> protein product menin has recently been implicated as an epigenetic modifier of Axin2, a component within the 
   <italic>
     Wnt 
   </italic> pathway as well as an APC-associated protein 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Chen1">
     [8] 
   </xref>. Our study vaguely implies that menin might regulate the levels of 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter methylation at the DNA level in parathyroid cells, since cases with 
   <italic>
     MEN1 
   </italic> mutations in general displayed higher levels of methylation than wild-type cases. Further molecular studies are needed to investigate the potential role of menin as a DNA regulator of 
   <italic>
     APC 
   </italic> promoter methylation status in addition to its known role as an Axin2 regulator through histone methylation.</p> 
  <p>The 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> promoter was found to be hypermethylated in nearly all parathyroid adenomas examined and 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> gene expression levels were considerably reduced in adenomas compared to normal parathyroid tissue. These data strongly support the involvement of this tumour suppressor gene in parathyroid tumorigenesis. In unrelated tumour tissues, 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> promoter methylation has been shown to greatly diminish the levels of 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> mRNA transcription, and subsequent usage of demethylating agents such as 5-Aza-CdR reconstitutes the 
   <italic>
     RASSF1A 
   </italic> transcription levels 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009472-Shen1">
     [34] 
   </xref>. The role of 
   <italic>

  <p>Regarding

Moreover, studies have shown that normal adrenal as well as normal colonic mucosa in general shows

   </italic> methylation also can be found in parathyroid tissue with an disproportionate growth pattern, albeit not a tumour per definition. Interestingly, cyclin D1 over-expression is also found in a fraction of cases with secondary hyperparathyroidism, suggesting that a subset of these lesions are propelled in parts by processes similar to those present in parathyroid adenomas and carcinomas

This finding was unexpected, considering the current notion that human cancers generally exhibit global hypomethylation.

The authors furthermore observed noteworthy clinical improvement among MDS patients when treated with hypomethylation-inducing agents, suggesting that the global hypermethylation was of clinical significance in this tumour type. Hence, these data suggest that not all tumours display relative hypomethylation globally compared to their corresponding normal tissues. In addition, we found that male cases displayed significantly higher levels of
