    <h3>Abstract</h3> 
    <p>The transcription factor ATF2 has been shown to attenuate melanoma susceptibility to apoptosis and to promote its ability to form tumors in xenograft models. To directly assess ATF2's role in melanoma development, we crossed a mouse melanoma model (

     </italic> mice, in primary human melanocytes, and in 50% of human melanoma cell lines. Inhibition of MITF transcription by MITF was shown to be mediated by ATF2-JunB–dependent suppression of SOX10 transcription. Remarkably, oncogenic BRAF (V600E)–dependent focus formation of melanocytes on soft agar was inhibited by ATF2 knockdown and partially rescued upon shMITF co-expression. On melanoma tissue microarrays, a high nuclear ATF2 to MITF ratio in primary specimens was associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis. Our findings establish the importance of transcriptionally active ATF2 in melanoma development through fine-tuning of MITF expression.</p>

    <h3>Author Summary</h3> 
    <p>Understanding mechanisms underlying early stages in melanoma development is of major interest and importance. Recent studies indicate a role for MITF, a master regulator of melanocyte development and biogenesis, in melanoma progression. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor ATF2 negatively regulates MITF transcription in melanocytes and in about 50% of melanoma cell lines. Increased MITF expression, seen upon inhibition of ATF2, effectively attenuated the ability of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-expressing melanocytes to exhibit a transformed phenotype, an effect partially rescued when MITF expression was also blocked. Significantly, the development of melanoma in mice carrying genetic changes seen in human tumors was inhibited upon inactivation of ATF2 in melanocytes. Melanocytes from mice lacking active ATF2 expressed increased levels of MITF, confirming that ATF2 negatively regulates MITF and implicating this newly discovered regulatory link in melanoma development. Primary melanoma specimens that exhibit a high nuclear ATF2-to-MITF ratio were found to be associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis, further substantiating the significance of MITF control by ATF2. In all, these findings provide genetic evidence for the role of ATF2 in melanoma development and indicate an ATF2 function in fine-tuning MITF expression, which is central to understanding MITF control at the early phases of melanocyte transformation.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3> 
  <p>Malignant melanoma is one of the most highly invasive and metastatic tumors 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-GraySchopfer1">
     [1] 
   </xref>, and its incidence has been increasing at a higher rate than other cancers in recent years 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Fears1">
     [2] 
   </xref>. Significant advances in understanding melanoma biology have been made over the past few years, thanks to identification of genetic changes along the MAPK signaling pathway. Those include mutations in

   <italic>
     NRAS, KIT and GNAQ,

   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Mitra1">
     [11]

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-LopezBergami1">
     [4] 
   </xref>. Among examples of rewired signaling is upregulation of C-JUN expression and activity 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-LopezBergami2">
     [8] 
   </xref>, which potentiates other pathways, including PDK1, AKT and PKC, and plays a critical role in melanoma development

  <p>Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a member of the bZIP family, is activated by stress kinases including JNK and p38 and is implicated in transcriptional regulation of immediate early genes regulating stress and DNA damage responses

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Nakamura1">
     [16] 
   </xref>. To activate transcription, ATF2 heterodimerizes with bZIP proteins, including C-JUN and CREB

     [17] 
   </xref>,

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-LopezBergami2">
     [8] 
   </xref>. ATF2 is also implicated in the DNA damage response through phosphorylation by ATM/ATR 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Bhoumik1">
     [19] 
   </xref>. Knock-in mice expressing a form of ATF2 that cannot be phosphorylated by ATM are more susceptible to tumor development 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Li1">
     [20] 
   </xref>. Nuclear localization of ATF2 in melanoma tumor cells is associated with poor prognosis 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Berger2">
     [21] 
   </xref>, likely due to transcriptional activity of constitutively active ATF2. Indeed, expression of transcriptionally inactive ATF2 or peptides that attenuate endogenous ATF2 activity inhibits melanoma development and progression in xenograft models 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Bhoumik2">

   </xref>– 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Ronai1">
     [26] 
   </xref>. These studies suggest that ATF2 is required for melanoma development and progression.</p> 
  <p>The transcription factor MITF has been shown to play a central role in melanocyte biology and in melanoma progression

   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Hoek1">
     [28]

Factors controlling MITF transcription have been well documented and include transcriptional activators, such as SOX10, CREB, PAX3, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1, also known as TCF), onecut domain 2 (ONECUT-2) and MITF itself

  <p>To directly assess the importance of ATF2 in melanoma development, we employed a mouse melanoma model in which ATF2 is selectively inactivated in melanocytes. We demonstrate that melanoma development is markedly attenuated in mice expressing a transcriptionally inactive form of ATF2 in melanocytes. Surprisingly, ATF2 control of melanoma development was mediated, in part, through its negative regulation of SOX10 and consequently of MITF transcription. Inhibition of ATF2 abolished mutant BRAF-expressing melanocytes' ability to form foci on soft agar, which was partially rescued when expression of MITF was attenuated. The significance of these findings is underscored by our observation of human melanoma tumors, in which high ratio of nuclear ATF2 to MITF expression was associated with poor prognosis. These findings identify a novel mechanism underlying melanocyte transformation and melanoma development.</p>

   <h3>MITF transcription is negatively regulated by ATF2 in about 50% of human melanoma cells</h3> 
   <p>Given that ATF2 negatively regulates MITF in melanocytes of mouse and human tissues and in related melanocyte cell lines, we asked whether ATF2 also regulates MITF in human melanoma cells. Initially, we assessed changes in MITF expression in six human melanoma lines harboring oncogenic mutations in 
    <italic>
      BRAF 
    </italic> or 
    <italic>
      NRAS 
    </italic>, and in which ATF2 expression was effectively inhibited by corresponding shRNA (shATF2). In all cases, shRNA specificity was confirmed using three independent sequences (data not shown). Surprisingly, the six melanoma lines fell into two classes based on distinct patterns of regulation of MITF by ATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001258-t004">
      Table 4 
    </xref>). The first class comprised four of the six melanoma cultures (1205Lu, WM35, WM793 and WM1361), in which MITF expression was elevated 3–6-fold following inhibition of ATF2 expression ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g003">
      Figure 3c 
    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s002">
      S2a 
    </xref>). Conversely, a second class of cells, including MeWo and 501Mel cells, exhibited decreased MITF expression after ATF2 knockdown (KD), suggesting positive regulation of MITF by ATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g003">
      Figure 3d 
    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s002">
      S2b 
    </xref>). Notably, this latter group showed high levels of basal MITF expression 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Kido1">
      [41] 
    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Vachtenheim1">
      [42] 
    </xref>, suggesting that regulation of MITF expression in these cells differs mechanistically from that of the first group. Further, in response to stress (UV or hypoxia) the MeWo and 501Mel lines further reduced MITF expression ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g003">
      Figure 3d 
    </xref> and data not shown), providing further evidence for differential regulation of MITF in these cells both prior to and in response to stress stimuli. Additional analyses were performed, employing 12 more melanoma cell lines. Inhibition of ATF2 expression revealed that 4/12 exhibited increase in MITF expression, while 6/12 decreased MITF expression. Two of the 12 lines did not exhibit change in MITF expression following ATF2 KD ( 
    <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001258-t004">
      Table 4 
    </xref>, S5). Collectively, out of 18 melanoma lines we found that 8 (44%) retained similar negative regulation of MITF by ATF2 as observed in the melanocytes. However, another 8 (44%) exhibited positive regulation of MITF by ATF2, pointing to a transcriptional switch that occurred in the course of melanocyte transformation. MITF was not affected by altered ATF2 expression in 2/18 cell lines ( 
    <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001258-t004">

    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s005">
      Figure S5 
    </xref>). In all, in about 50% of the melanoma cell lines ATF2 elicits negative regulation of MITF, similar to what was seen in human and mouse melanocytes.</p>

    <h3>Negative regulation of MITF by ATF2 is mediated by SOX10.</h3> 
    <p>A. ATF2 was knocked down in human melanocytes (Hermes 3A) and qPCR was carried out using primers for the indicated mRNAs. B. Melanoma cells (WM1361, one 10 cm plate each, 50% confluent) were transduced with either empty or shATF2 lentiviral particles. Cells were selected for 3 days with puromycin treatment (1.5 µg/ml) and then transfected with either a WT MITF-luciferase reporter or one with a mutant BRN2 site (0.5 µg) along with ?-gal (0.1 µg) as an internal control. ?-gal activity was normalized for every sample and the relative fold change in reporter activity for control and shATF2 cells is shown. Right Panel- Analysis was performed in WM1361 melanoma cells using a WT or CRE-mutated MITF promoter. C. Analysis was performed as in panel B using human melanocytes H3A (

     <italic>
       right panel 
     </italic>) and the WT MITF promoter or a construct in which the SOX10 site was mutated. D. Human melanocytes (H3A; one 10 cm plate each, 50% confluent) were infected with control shRNA (SiSC) or shATF2. After puromycin selection for 3 days, control shRNA cells and ATF2 knock down cells (2×10<sup>6</sup>) were transfected with either scrambled siRNA (SiSC) or siRNA against SOX10. After 72 h, Western analysis was carried out using 50 µg of proteins and the indicated antibodies. E. The same analysis was performed in human melanoma cells.

   </fig> 
   <p>To assess the possible role of FOXD3 in regulation of MITF we inhibited FOXD3 expression in melanocytes expressing control shRNA and shATF2. Inhibition of FOXD3 expression increased SOX10 transcription and protein expression, albeit to lower levels compared with inhibition of ATF2 expression ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s004">
      Figure S4 
    </xref>). Concomitant increase of MITF RNA and protein levels was also lower, compared with that seen upon inhibition of ATF2 expression. Notably, inhibition of both ATF2 and FOXD3 resulted in additive increase of SOX10 and MITF ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s004">
      Figure S4 
    </xref>). These data suggest that FOXD3 may also contribute to negative regulation of MITF in melanocytes, independent of ATF2. Since inhibition of FOXD3 elicited a less pronounced effect compared with ATF2, and since the effect appeared ATF2-independent and furthermore did not appear to mediate similar changes in human melanoma cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s003">
      Figure S3b 
    </xref> and data not shown), we focused on assessment of direct mechanisms underlying ATF2 effect on MITF transcription.</p> 
   <p>To this end we first analyzed MITF promoter sequences for ATF2/CRE elements (Cyclic AMP response element), which can be targeted by ATF2, as well as sequences recognized by BRN2 and SOX10 using a luciferase reporter construct (MITF-Luc) 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Goding1">
      [43] 
    </xref>. Using either a wild-type (WT) construct or one in which the BRN2 site was mutated, we observed increased luciferase activity following inhibition of ATF2 transcription in WM1361 melanoma ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">
      Figure 4b 
    </xref>), as well as in LU1205 and WM35 melanoma cells (data not shown). The relative increase in luciferase activity following ATF2 inhibition was equivalent in both constructs, suggesting that an ATF2 effect is not mediated by BRN2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">
      Figure 4b 
    </xref>, left panel). Similarly, MITF transcriptional activities were altered to a similar degree following inactivation of the CRE element ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">
      Figure 4b 
    </xref>, right panel), suggesting that ATF2 down-regulation of the MITF promoter is indirect. We therefore assessed whether SOX10, which positively regulates MITF and whose transcription markedly increases in melanocytes and melanoma cells in which ATF2 expression is inhibited ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">
      Figure 4a 
    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s003">
      S3b 
    </xref>), may mediate ATF2 effect on MITF transcription. Analysis of a MITF-Luc construct harboring a mutant SOX10 binding site revealed that ATF2 inhibition no longer elicited increased MITF transcription in human melanocytes or in melanoma cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">
      Figure 4c 
    </xref>). In agreement, inhibition of SOX10 expression by corresponding siRNA attenuated the increase in MITF transcription seen in shATF2-expressing human melanocytes ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">

    </xref>) or melanoma cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g004">
      Figure 4e 
    </xref>). These results suggest that ATF2 regulation of MITF transcription is mediated by SOX10. In agreement, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed increased binding of SOX10 to the MITF promoter in melanoma cells expressing shATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">

    <h3>ATF2 and JunB negatively regulate SOX10 transcription, with concomitant effect on MITF.</h3> 
    <p>A. Chromatin immuno-precipitation were performed using antibodies to SOX10 or CREB (or rabbit IgG as control) in WM1361 melanoma cells expressing either control shRNA or ATF2 shRNA. The MITF promoter sequence spanning ?300 to ?120 (180bp containing SOX10 binding sites and a CRE site) was amplified using MITF-specific primers. GAPDH served as a control. B. ChIP was performed using the indicated antibodies followed by amplification of the SOX10 promoter sequence containing AP-1 binding sites (?4797 to ?4791). GAPDH served as control. C. ChIP analysis was carried out using ATF2 or JunB antibodies in cells that express either shcontrol, shATF2 or Jun DN construct TAM67. D. Expression of JunB or JunD (3 µg) alone or in combination with TAM67 (2 µg) was performed in WM1361 melanoma cells and expression of SOX10 protein was monitored in westerns and quantified using the LICOR imaging system. Corresponding changes in level of MITF transcripts were assessed by qPCR (Lower panel). E. Experiment similar to shown in panel D was performed in the melanocytes H3A cell line. F. The effect of JunB on SOX10 expression was assessed in melanoma WM1361 cells expressing control or shATF2. The right panel shows the level of MITF transcripts quantified by qPCR.</p>

   <p>A putative response element for AP1 (which can serve as an ATF2 response element through ATF2 heterodimerization with JUN family members; 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-LopezBergami3">
      [9] 
    </xref>) has been identified in upstream regions of the Sox10 promoter 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Deal1">
      [44] 
    </xref>. We examined potential ATF2 binding to this element by ChIP and found that endogenous ATF2, but not ATFa, binds to that AP1 sequence (?4797–4791) in both human melanocytes and melanoma cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5b 
    </xref>). We next set to identify ATF2 heterodimeric partner, which could mediate negative regulation of SOX10 transcription. Among members of the JUN family implicated in transcriptional silencing is JunB. Thus, further assessment was performed to determine if JunB functions as an ATF2 heterodimerization partner to regulate SOX10 transcription through the AP1 site. ChIP analysis confirmed that JunB binds to the AP1 site found in SOX10 promoter sequences ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5c 
    </xref>). To confirm a possible role for JunB in regulating MITF transcription we asked whether expression of TAM67, a negative regulator of Jun family members, could attenuate the binding and transcriptional activities elicited by JunB. Expression of TAM67 indeed reduced the degree of ATF2 and JunB binding to the AP1 site on SOX10 promoter. Further, KD of ATF2 expression abolished binding of both ATF2 and JunB to the AP1 site on the SOX10 promoter ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5c 
    </xref>). These data confirm the presence of ATF2-JunB complex on Sox10 promoter and suggest that ATF2 recruits JunB for binding to the AP1 site on SOX10 promoter. To assess the role of JunB on SOX10 transcription we have monitored changes in Sox10 expression at the protein and RNA levels. Expression of TAM67 caused increased expression of SOX10 in both human melanoma (?2 folds; 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5d 
    </xref>) and melanocytes (?3 folds; 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5e 
    </xref>), indicating some relief of JunB inhibition. Co-expression of TAM67 with Jun B attenuated this increase, reducing the level of Sox10 expression to basal levels ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5d, 5e 
    </xref>). Over-expression of JunB, but not Jun D, effectively inhibited Sox10 expression in both the melanoma and melanocytes cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5d, 5e 
    </xref>). These data suggest that JunB mediates inhibition of Sox10 expression. To further reveal the role of ATF2 in this inhibition, we assessed the effect of JunB on Sox10 expression in cells expressing control shRNA or shATF2. While ectopic expression of JunB reduced the expression of Sox10 in control shRNA-expressing cells, such decrease was no longer seen in cells expressing shATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g005">
      Figure 5f 
    </xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that ATF2, in concert with JunB, is responsible for inhibition of Sox10 expression.</p> 
   <p>We next assessed the effect of ATF2 on SOX10 and MITF expression in 12 additional human melanoma cell lines. In all cases cells were infected with shATF2 and changes in SOX10 and MITF were monitored at the level of RNA. Notably, about 4/12 melanoma lines revealed increase in both SOX10 and MITF expression upon KD of ATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s005">
      Figure S5 
    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001258-t004">
      Table 4 
    </xref>). In contrast, 6/12 melanoma lines revealed decrease in MITF expression, of which 5 also shown decrease in SOX10 expression, pointing to positive regulation of SOX10 and MITF in these melanoma cells. In two out of the 12 melanoma lines ATF2 affected SOX10 but not MITF transcription ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s005">
      Figure S5 
    </xref>). Overall, our cohort of 18 melanoma lines revealed that about 50% of the melanomas retained negative regulation of MITF by ATF2, as seen in the melanocytes (primary and cell lines) ( 
    <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001258-t004">
      Table 4 
    </xref>).</p> 
   <p>To further assess whether ATF2 regulation of MITF is SOX10-dependent in melanocytes and melanoma cells, we coexpressed SOX10 in shATF2-expressing cells. As seen in earlier analysis, inhibition of ATF2 expression caused increase in MITF transcription in the human melanocytes and 4 melanoma cell lines, (WM1361, WM793, LU1205, WM35; 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s006">
      Figure S6 
    </xref>). Notably, the melanocytes and 2/4 melanoma cell lines revealed ATF2 effect on MITF expression is SOX10-dependent (WM1361, WM793; 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s006">
      Figure S6 
    </xref>). Two of the four melanoma cell lines did not reveal increased SOX10 expression, although they retained increased MITF expression, upon inhibition of ATF2 (Lu1205, WM35; 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s006">
      Figure S6 
    </xref>). These findings confirm that while in melanocytes, expression of SOX10 and MITF is negatively regulated by ATF2, this mechanism is conserved in approximately half of melanomas surveyed.</p> 
   <p>Along these lines, the two melanoma lines (MeWo and 501 Mel) that exhibit positive regulation of MITF by ATF2 also exhibited positive regulation of SOX10 by ATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s007">
      Figure S7 
    </xref>). Inhibition of ATF2 expression reduced SOX10 and MITF RNA and protein levels ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s007">
      Figure S7a–c 
    </xref>). In order to determine whether JunB lost its ability to elicit negative regulation of SOX10 and MITF in melanoma cells where ATF2 no longer inhibited SOX10 or MITF expression, we transfected those cell lines with TAM67 and JunB alone and in combination. In these cells, whereas TAM67 effectively attenuated Sox10 and MITF expression, JunB did not alter expression of these genes, suggesting that positive regulation of MITF and SOX10 by ATF2 depends on other members of the Jun family of transcription factors ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s007">
      Figure S7d 
    </xref>). Conversely, TAM67 or JunB had no effect on melanoma cells in which ATF2 inhibits MITF independently of SOX10, suggesting that in these cases, ATF2 likely cooperates with transcription factors other than JunB to elicit negative regulation of SOX10 and MITF ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s007">
      Figure S7d 
    </xref>). Consistent with this observation, ChIP assay confirmed ATF2 and CREB, but not JunB, binding to the Sox10 promoter in these cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s007">
      Figure S7e 
    </xref>). These findings suggest that changes in ATF2 heterodimeric partner (from JunB to CREB) are likely to cause the switch from negative to positive regulation of SOX10, and in turn, MITF (see below). The possibility that altered expression of JunB may account for ATF2 positive or negative regulation of Sox10 and MITF were excluded, as no clear correlation between JunB expression and the ability of ATF2 to elicit negative regulation of Sox10/MITF were seen ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s007">
      Figure S7f 
    </xref>).</p> 
   <p>Among response elements potentially required to upregulate MITF transcription is the CRE element, which is implicated in CREB-mediated upregulation of MITF transcription 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Poser1">
      [45] 
    </xref>. Although transcriptional activity from a CRE mutant MITF promoter was lower compared to the WT promoter (30%), it was no longer responsive to inhibition of ATF2 expression in the MeWo cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s008">
      Figure S8a 
    </xref>). Pull-down assays using biotin-tagged MITF promoter sequences harboring the CRE identified ATF2 and CREB as CRE-bound proteins in MeWo melanoma cells ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s008">
      Figure S8b 
    </xref>). In agreement, ChIP analysis confirmed occupancy of the CRE site on MITF promoter by ATF2 ( 
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001258.s008">
      Figure S8c 
    </xref>). These findings are consistent with the fact that ATF2 heterodimerizes with CREB

   <h3>Inhibition of MITF expression rescues focus formation on soft agar in shATF2-expressing melanocytes</h3> 
   <p>To determine whether the contribution of ATF2 to melanocyte transformation and development is MITF-dependent, we assessed melanocytes' ability to grow and form colonies in soft agar, which is indicative of their transformed potential. Expression of mutant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in immortal melanocytes is reportedly sufficient for growth on soft agar

    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6b, 6c, 6d

    </xref>– 
    <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1001258-t002">
      2 
    </xref>). To determine the importance of MITF at this early stage of melanocyte transformation we inhibited MITF expression (using shRNA) in melanocytes expressing mutant BRAF alone or mutant BRAF+shATF2. Significantly, inhibition of MITF expression decreased the number of BRAF-induced foci (from 1000 to about 100 per well). Over-expression of MITF in BRAF-expressing melanocytes also inhibited focus formation, to a degree similar to that seen following inhibition of MITF expression ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6b, 6c, 6d 
    </xref>). This observation implies that effective inhibition or overexpression of MITF attenuates melanocyte transformation, consistent with previous reports (52). Remarkably, inhibition of MITF expression in melanocytes expressing both mutant BRAF and shATF2 rescued, at least partially, melanocytes' ability to form foci on soft agar (400 compared with 20 seen in shATF2 cells; 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6b, 6c, 6d 
    </xref>). These findings suggest that inhibition of MITF expression in melanocytes lacking ATF2 expression can promote transformation. That MITF inhibition in melanocytes expressing ATF2 WT can attenuate their ability to form foci on soft agar is attributable to the relative expression of MITF RNA and protein in each condition ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6d 
    </xref>). MITF expression levels in ATF2 KD cells increased 7.5-fold compared with control BRAF-expressing melanocytes. Inhibition of MITF expression in ATF2 KD melanocytes reduced MITF expression 2.5-fold relative to controls, whereas MITF KD alone resulted in lower MITF expression (5-fold; 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6d 
    </xref>). Thus, complete abrogation of MITF expression attenuates melanocyte transformation, whereas low to moderate levels of MITF expression are sufficient to promote growth on soft agar. Higher MITF expression levels, as seen in ATF2 KD cells, result in a total loss of melanocytes' ability to form foci on soft agar. These findings are in line with the proposed rheostat model in which medium levels of MITF are optimal for growth and melanoma development

   <p>We next assessed whether inhibition of melanocyte growth on soft agar by altered ATF2 and/or MITF expression can be attributed to decreased proliferation or increased apoptosis. Inhibition of ATF2 expression caused notable accumulation of cells in G2 (60%), with significant cell death induction (22%) compared to controls (4%), ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6e, 6f 
    </xref>). Interestingly, such altered cell cycle distribution and cell death rate were associated with a significant increase in MITF protein levels ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6d 
    </xref>). In contrast, inhibition of MITF expression did not significantly induce cell death (6.5%) but resulted in fewer cells in G2/M-phase and more cells in G1, compared with inhibition of ATF2 alone. These observations suggest that MITF inhibition is sufficient to reduce the rate of cell cycle progression through G2/M phase and that inhibited growth of BRAF<sup>600E</sup>-expressing melanocytes on soft agar may be attributed to abrogation of distinct cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms. Combined inhibition of ATF2 and MITF restored cell cycle distribution to that seen in control melanocytes, and reduced cell death from 22.4% to 12.9%. Of interest, MITF overexpression promoted a similar degree of cell death (11.4%) without altering cell cycle distribution, similar to combined inhibition of ATF2 and MITF ( 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001258-g006">
      Figure 6e, 6f

   <p>The availability of a melanoma TMA, consisting of over 500 melanoma samples and in which expression of both ATF2 and MITF in the same tumors had been measured enabled us to assess possible associations between ATF2 and MITF and their correlation with survival and other clinical and pathological factors.

  <h3>Discussion</h3> 
  <p>Identifying mechanisms underlying early phases of melanocyte transformation and melanoma development is central to understanding the etiology of this devastating tumor, as well as for developing novel treatment approaches. Previous studies indicate the presence of mutant BRAF in melanocytic lesions, as well as its effect on pigment gene expression

   </xref>. The present study enhances our understanding of early events contributing to melanoma development. We demonstrate that loss of a transcriptionally active form of ATF2 in melanocytes inhibits melanoma development in an Nras/Ink4a model. Our quest to understand mechanisms underlying ATF2 activity in this process led us to identify an important role for ATF2 regulation of MITF, an important regulator of melanocyte biogenesis and a factor implicated in melanoma progression

     [49] 
   </xref>. Surprisingly, ATF2 negatively regulated MITF expression in mouse and human melanocytes, suggesting that ATF2 transcriptional activities limit MITF expression. We demonstrate that such negative regulation is elicited through downregulation of SOX10 by ATF2, in cooperation with JunB. A putative AP1 response element has been identified in SOX10 promoter sequences and ChIP analysis of this domain showed ATF2 and JunB binding. Overexpression of JunB efficiently suppressed SOX10 expression in an ATF2-dependent manner and inhibition of Jun transcriptional activities phenocopied the effect of shATF2, suggesting that negative regulation of SOX10 by ATF2 is direct, and is mediated in cooperation with JunB.</p> 
  <p>Importantly, ATF2-dependent negative regulation of Sox10 and consequently of MITF seen in melanocytes, but only in about 50% of the 18 melanoma cell lines studied here. Correspondingly, JunB, which is required for ATF2-dependent inhibition of Sox10 transcription, is no longer found on the promoter of SOX10 in melanoma cells (i.e. 501Mel) that exhibit positive regulation by ATF2. Rather, CREB and ATF2 are found on SOX10 and MITF promoters, pointing to a switch in ATF2 heterodimeric partners to enable positive regulation of these genes. Notably, melanoma cell lines that exhibit positive regulation of SOX10 and MITF by ATF2, also show high basal levels of MITF expression

  <p>Notably, ATF2 control of MITF expression affected the ability of BRAF<sup>600E</sup>-expressing melanocytes to exhibit transformed phenotype in culture, monitored by their ability to grow on soft agar. Inhibition of ATF2 abolished soft agar growth of BRAF<sup>600E</sup>-expressing melanocytes, which was partially rescued upon KD of MITF. Interestingly, both the over expression or the KD of MITF resulted in inhibition of melanocytes ability to grow on soft agar, substantiating the notion that a fine balance of MITF expression must be maintained in order to ensure its contribution to cellular proliferation and transformation. We propose that excessively low or high MITF levels block melanocyte transformation, whereas intermediate levels allow transformation to occur. Overall, our observations demonstrate that ATF2 plays an important role in fine-tuning those levels and support the rheostat model proposed for MITF's role in melanoma development and progression 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001258-Vance1">
     [48] 
   </xref>. Of importance, ATF2 and MITF affect the ability of BRAF<sup>600E</sup>-expressing melanocytes to grow on soft agar via distinct mechanisms. Whereas specific inhibition of ATF2 causes both accumulation of cells in G2 and induction of cell death, specific alteration of MITF protein levels—particularly depletion—significantly affects cell proliferation and inhibit growth on soft agar by non-lethally slowing cell cycle progression at G2/M. These observations are consistent with a report from Wellbrock and Marais

     [52] 
   </xref>, who showed that altered MITF expression inhibits melanocyte proliferation.</p> 
  <p>Importantly, inhibiting MITF expression in ATF2 KD melanocytes was sufficient to partially rescue melanocyte growth on soft agar. While supportive of our finding in the 
   <italic>

   </italic> mouse melanoma model, where expression of transcriptionally inactive ATF2 inhibits melanoma formation, these observations provide the foundation for a model in which ATF2 inhibition causes increased MITF levels and concomitant inhibition of melanocyte growth, possible induction of cell death and delayed development. The latter is suggested by IHC analysis of mouse skin from

This delay was seen at the 4- but not the 14-day time point, suggesting that an ATF2 effect might be limited to a specific subpopulation or phase of melanocyte development. The early (4 day) time point is within the time frame that allows induction of melanoma development by UV-irradiation of

   </xref>. It is therefore plausible that timely control of MITF expression by ATF2 determines melanocyte susceptibility to transformation.</p> 
  <p>Our analysis of genes whose expression is altered by ATF2 KD in melanocytes identified a cluster of pigmentation genes, many reportedly regulated by MITF

   </xref>. Therefore, changes in TYRP1, DCT and SILVER expression could be attributed to altered MITF expression. However, initial analysis points to a more complex mechanism since (i) the degree of changes in expression of these genes was often greater than that seen for MITF and (ii) expression of some pigmentation genes was found to be independent of MITF in some melanoma and melanocyte cultures. Hence, further studies are required to address mechanisms underlying ATF2 regulation of these pigmentation genes and the significance of such regulation to melanocyte transformation and melanoma development. While our present studies focused on the ATF2-MITF axis, it is expected that additional ATF2-regulated genes contribute to melanoma development

The skin was submerged in 1× Trypsin/EDTA overnight at 4°C and next day, the skin was placed in a Petri dish with mouse melanocyte culture medium (described below). The epidermis and sheared tissue was removed and discarded with forceps. The tissue was transferred to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and vortexed vigorously until solution becomes cloudy (1–2 min). The cell suspension was transferred to tissue culture flasks. After 3 days, melanocyte growth medium containing 0.8 µg/ml geneticin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts (melanocytes are resistant to such treatment). Geneticin-containing medium was removed and replaced with fresh media after 1 day. Media was changed twice a week. Primary mouse melanocytes were grown in F-12 media (Invitrogen) containing 20% L-15 media (Invitrogen), 4% of FBS and Horse serum (Invitrogen), Penicillin (100 units) and streptomycin (50 µg) antibiotics, db-cAMP (40 µM, Sigma-Aldrich), 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 50 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (?-MSH, 80 nM, Sigma-Aldrich), Fungizone (2.5 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and melanocyte growth supplement (Invitrogen). Primary melanocytes were treated with 4-OHT (10 µM) for 8h followed by addition of doxycycline (2 µg/ml) for 24h to inactivate ATF2 and induce expression of N-Ras.</p>

   <h3>Constructs</h3> 
   <p>ATF2-specific shRNA clones were obtained from Open Biosystems (catalog no. RHS4533). Five different shRNA were obtained and tested for their efficiency of KD. Clone TRCN0000013714 was more efficient in inhibiting ATF2 in human cell lines while clone TRCN0000013713 was more efficient for knocking down mouse ATF2. For subsequent experiments we used the respective shATF2 clone depending on human or mouse cell lines. We also tested 3 different clones for KD of ATF2 to rule out any off target effect (Data not shown). siRNA control (cat # 4611) and three SOX10-specific siRNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Ambion (cat # 4392420). Four FOXD3 specific siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon (Cat # J-009152-06 -07, -08, -09). These siRNAs were pooled together in equimolar ratio for transient transfection. An MITF specific shRNA, and MITF promoter luciferase constructs (WT and mutant CRE-Luc constructs) were obtained from Dr. David Fisher

   <h3>Microarray analysis</h3> 
   <p>Primary melanocytes were treated with 4-OHT and Doxycycline before isolation of total RNA. 500 ng of total RNA was used for synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA using an RNA amplification kit (Ambion). The biotinylated cRNA is labeled by incubation with streptavidin-Cy3 to generate probe for hybridization with the Mouse-6 Expression BeadChip (Illumina MOUSE-6_V1_1_11234304_A) that represents 46.6K mouse gene transcripts. We analyzed the BeadChips using the manufacturers BeadArray Reader and collected primary data using the supplied Scanner software. Data analysis was done as follows. First, expression intensities were calculated for each gene probed on the array for all hybridizations using illumina's BeadStudio 3.0 software. Second, intensity values were quality controlled and normalized: quality control was carried out by using the BeadStudio detection P-value set to &lt;0.01 as a cutoff. This removed genes which were never detected in the arrays. All the arrays were then normalized using the cubic spline routine from the BeadStudio 3.0 software. This procedure accounted for any variation in hybridization intensity between the individual arrays. Finally, these normalized data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes. The groups of 2 biological and 2 technical replicates were described to the BeadStudio 3.0 software and significantly differentially expressed genes were determined on the basis of the difference changes in expression level (Illumina DiffScor&gt;60 or DiffScore&lt;?60) and expression difference p-value&lt;0.01.

The virus was replaced with fresh media after 8 hours of infection. After two days, puromycin (1.5 µg/ml) was used to select cells for 3 days. For human and mouse melanocytes the media was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS 24 h prior to harvesting cells. 50 nM duplexes of scrambled and SOX10- or FOXD3- specific siRNA were transfected into human melanocytes and WM1361 melanoma cells (2 million cells per transfection) by Nucleofection using Amaxa reagents (NHEM-Neo Nucleofector and Solution R respectively) for SOX10 or FOXD3 knock down. Over 90% of the cells transduced were able to resist drug selection, indicating efficient infection of the respective genes.

Indicated cell lines were infected with shControl or shATF2, in the presence or absence of SOX10 overexpression, and proteins were prepared to determine changes in expression of SOX10. ?-actin was used as loading control. Analysis of MITF and SOX10 transcript levels was carried out in the indicated cell lines using qPCR on RNA prepared from the cells that were infected with indicated vectors (C, C+SOX10, shATF2, shATF2+SOX10).</p>

   <p>Effect of ATF2 on SOX10 and MITF in human melanoma cell lines exhibiting positive regulation by ATF2. A. Melanoma cell lines MeWo and 501Mel were infected with shControl or shATF2 and level of SOX10 protein was assessed. B, C. The effect of SOX10 expression on MITF (B) and on SOX10 (C) transcripts in MeWO (left graph) cells expressing control or shATF2 was determined using qPCR. D. Effect of DN Jun and JunB on SOX10 protein and MITF transcript levels. Indicated melanoma cells were transfected with TAM67 (DN Jun) and JUNB either alone or in combination as indicated. The cells were lysed and proteins and RNA were prepared. Western blotting was carried out with the indicated antibodies. QPCR analysis for MITF transcripts was performed (lower panel). E. Chromatin IP reveals loss of JunB binding to SOX10 promoter in melanoma cells in which MITF is positively regulated by ATF2. Melanoma cells were subjected to ChIP using the indicated antibodies followed by PCR of SOX10 promoter sequences harboring the AP1 response element. F. Endogenous level of JUNB in various melanoma cells. Cell lysates from indicated melanoma cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using JUNB antibody. ?–actin was used as a loading control.</p>

   <p>A. Transcriptional activity of MITF is dependent on ATF2 and a CRE element in specific melanoma cells that express high MITF levels. WT and mutant (CRE) forms of MITF-Luc constructs were used to assess the contribution of ATF2 to MITF transcription in MeWo cells. Luciferase assays were performed as detailed in

    </xref>. B. ATF2 and CREB bind to a MITF CRE site. Human melanoma (MeWo) cells were treated with 20mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of UVB, and proteins prepared after 1h were incubated with dI/dT (20 µg/ml for 30 min at 4C) and then with a biotinylated annealed oligo (4 µg, overnight at 4°C) containing the CRE site and flanking sequences from the MITF promoter. Streptavidin beads were added to lysates and bound material was analyzed on immunoblots with the indicated antibodies. C. ChIP analysis shows ATF2 binding to the MITF CRE site in specific melanoma MeWo cells. Chromatin was prepared and precipitated using an ATF2 antibody and bound DNA was amplified using MITF specific primers that flank the CRE binding site and analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel. Rabbit IgG served as a negative control and CREB and ATF1 served as positive controls.</p>
