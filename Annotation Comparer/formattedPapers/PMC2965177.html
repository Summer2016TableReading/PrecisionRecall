    <h3>Abstract</h3> 
    <sec> 
     <h3>Background</h3> 
     <p>The Ras association domain family 1 (RASSF1) gene is a Ras effector encoding two major mRNA forms, RASSF1A and RASSF1C, derived by alternative promoter selection and alternative mRNA splicing. RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene. However, very little is known about the function of RASSF1C both in normal and transformed cells.</p> 
    </sec> 
    <sec> 
     <h3>Methods</h3> 
     <p>Gene silencing and over-expression techniques were used to modulate RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells. Affymetrix-microarray analysis was performed using T47D cells over-expressing RASSF1C to identify RASSF1C target genes. RT-PCR and western blot techniques were used to validate target gene expression. Cell invasion and apoptosis assays were also performed.</p> 
    </sec> 
    <sec> 
     <h3>Results</h3> 
     <p>In this article, we report the effects of altering RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells. We found that silencing RASSF1C mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231 and T47D) caused a small but significant decrease in cell proliferation. Conversely, inducible over-expression of RASSF1C in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231 and T47D) resulted in a small increase in cell proliferation. We also report on the identification of novel RASSF1C target genes. RASSF1C down-regulates several pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes and up-regulates several growth promoting genes in breast cancer cells. We further show that down-regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces breast cancer cells' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent, etoposide. Furthermore, we found that RASSF1C over-expression enhances T47D cell invasion/migration

     <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>Together, our findings suggest that RASSF1C, unlike RASSF1A, is not a tumor suppressor, but instead may play a role in stimulating metastasis and survival in breast cancer cells.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3> 
  <p>The Ras association domain family 1 (RASSF1) proteins are postulated to function as Ras effectors and to affect cell growth. The RASSF1 gene resides on chromosome 3p21.3, a region that often undergoes homozygous or heterozygous deletions and hypermethylation-induced suppression in many human cancers [

     1 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
     2 
   </xref>]. The RASSF1 gene encodes multiple isoforms derived by alternative promoter selection and alternative mRNA splicing [

     1 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
     2 
   </xref>], with two major isoforms called RASSF1A and RASSF1C. The RASSFIA protein (340 amino acids) contains an amino-terminal diacyl glycerol binding domain (C1 domain), an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylation site, and a carboxy-terminal putative Ras association (RA) domain. The RASSFIC protein (270 amino acids) contains the ATM phosphorylation site and the RA domain, but not the C1 domain [

   </xref>].</p> 
  <p>RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene which is epigenetically inactivated by cytidine methylation in many human solid tumors. It has been reported that in 80 to 100% of lung cancer cell lines and tumors [

     3 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">

     9 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
     10 
   </xref>], the RASSF1A gene, but not the RASSF1C gene, is inactivated. In addition, RASSF1A over-expression reduces colony formation, suppresses anchorage independent growth, inhibits tumor growth in nude mice, and inhibits cell growth by inducing G1-S phase cell cycle arrest and by blocking cyclin D accumulation [

   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">

   </xref>]. Studies of RASSF1A knockout mice showed that RASSF1A -/- and RASSF1A+/- mice exhibit enhanced tumor multiplicity and tumor size compared to wild type animals upon exposure to the chemical carcinogens benzo(a) pyrene and urethane [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">

   </xref>].</p> 
  <p>The RASSF1C isoform differs from the RASSF1A isoform by having a distinct N-terminus and lacking the diacyl glycerol binding domain. Unlike RASSF1A, RASSF1C has not been extensively studied, and very little is known about its role in cell growth, survival, and metastasis. In contrast to RASSF1A, RASSF1C is expressed in almost all human solid tumors. The majority of published literature indicates that RASSF1C has no tumor-suppressor activity [

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">

  <h3>Methods</h3> 
  <sec> 
   <h3>Cell culture</h3> 
   <p>The human breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB231 and T47D were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cell culture was carried out as recommended by ATCC. Hs578T and MDA-MB231 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum. T47D cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum and 0.2 units/mL insulin. The human mammary epithelial cell line AG1132B was obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). Cell culture was carried out as recommended by the supplier.</p> 
  </sec> 
  <sec> 
   <h3>Transfection of cell lines with plasmid DNA</h3> 
   <p>The MDA-MB231 and T47D cell lines were transfected with siRNA-RASSF1C and control plasmids as previously described [ 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
      20 
    </xref>]. Since the shRNA plasmids used in this study would target both RASSF1A and RASSF1C mRNAs, we utilized breast cancer cells that express RASSF1C but not RASSF1A. Cells were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well in the appropriate medium with 10% calf serum in 24 and 6 well culture dishes, respectively. After 24 hr, the cells were transfected with 1 ?g/ml plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using recommended conditions. 48 hr post-transfection, cells were collected and were used for RNA extraction. 200 ng of total RNA was used to prepare cDNA with the Omniscript kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 100 ng of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used for PCR using the HotStart master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and PCR reactions were run with the following conditions: 95°C 1 min, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec for 35 cycles.</p>

   <h3>Alamar blue assay</h3> 
   <p>Cells were treated with either siRNA-RASSF1C (suppresses RASSF1C expression) or control plasmid for 48 hr, and cell proliferation was measured by the alamar blue assay as previously described [

   <h3>Construction of a tet-inducible expression system that expresses RASSF1C</h3> 
   <p>In order to over-express RASSF1C cDNA in human breast cancer cells in a regulated fashion, we chose to use a doxycycline (dox)-inducible Murine Leukemia Virus based retroviral vector that was developed in house (Chen et. al., manuscript in preparation). Using the YFP-RASSF1C plasmid [ 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
      18 
    </xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
      19 
    </xref>] as a template, the full-length HA-RASSF1C coding sequence was cloned using the forward primer: 5' GGG TCG ACG CGG CCG CC ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCGGATTACGCT GGC GAG GCTGAAACACCTT 3' and the reverse primer: 5' CGG GAT CC TCA CCC AAG GGG GCA GGC GTG CAG 3', and the HA-IGFBP-5 coding sequence was cloned using the forward primer: 5' GGG TCG ACG CGG CCG CC ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCGGATTACGCT GGC TCC TTC GTG CAC TGC GA 3', and the reverse primer: 5' CGG GAT CC TCA CTC AAC GTT GCT GCT GTC GAA 3' flanked by NotI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, respectively. The NotI and BamHI sites in the pGYT plasmid were used to insert the RASSF1C cDNA sequence down stream of the TetO and mammalian promoter. The correct cDNA sequence and orientation were confirmed by sequencing the pGYT-HA-RASSF1C plasmid. This plasmid then was used to produce VSV-G pseudotyped MLV-based vector as described [ 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
      20 
    </xref>].</p> 
   <p>MDA-MB231 and T47D breast cancer cell lines were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well in 6-well plates. After 24 hr of incubation, the cells were transduced with MLV-based vectors rtTA-GYT (vector without transgene), rtTA-GYT-GFP, and rtTA-GYT-HA-RASSF1C with different MOI in 6-well plates, using 2 or 3 serial infection cycles as described [ 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
      20 
    </xref>]. After 1-4 days, cells were treated with up to 1 × 10<sup>-6 </sup>M doxycycline (dox) for 48 hr. HA-RASSF1C expression was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. We tested the MLV-GFP vector expression in human breast cancer cell lines and demonstrated that a 10 fold induction of GFP expression can be achieved with a dox concentration of 1 ug/ml.</p>

   <h3>Silencing of RASSF1C decreases breast cancer cell proliferation</h3> 
   <p>Because RASSF1C and RASSF1A are structurally similar, but appear to have opposing effects, it is possible that they may interact and modulate each other's effects. Therefore, prior to silencing RASSF1C mRNA, the endogenous RASSF1A and RASSF1C mRNA levels were measured in MDA-MB231 and T47D breast cancer cells. RASSF1C is readily detectable, while RASSF1A is barely detectable in both cell lines (Figure

RASSF1A and RASSF1C cDNAs were used as templates as control for RASSF1A (1A-cont) and RASSF1C (1C-cont) primers and actin was used as an internal control. (B) MDA-MB231 and T47D breast cancer cells were transfected with psilencer-RASSF1C-258 (siRNA-1C) to silence RASSF1C and pSilencer (control) plasmids as previously described [

(D) RT-PCR analysis of RASSF1C expression in transfected MDA-MB231 and T47D either transfected with psilencer-RASSF1C-258 (siRNA-1C) or pSilencer plasmid alone (control).

   <p>Cells transfected with siRNA-RASSF1C plasmid showed a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in cell proliferation compared to cells transfected with control plasmid as judged by the alamar blue and the <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation assays (Figure

   <h3>Over-expression of RASSF1C in breast cancer cells does not inhibit breast cancer cell growth</h3> 
   <p>To further elucidate the function of RASSF1C and demonstrate that RASSF1C is not a tumor suppressor, we carried out RASSF1C over-expression studies in breast cancer cells using a tet-inducible Mouse Leukemia Virus-based retroviral vector to express HA-tagged RASSF1C fusion protein. Cells were stably transduced with MLV-backbone (BB) or MLV-RASSF1C (1C) as outlined in Materials and Methods. Western blot analysis using an anti-HA-tag antibody to detect the HA-RASSF1C fusion protein verified that RASSF1C was over-expressed in cells transduced with the MLV-RASSF1C vector following treatment with 1 ?g/ml doxycycline for 48 hr (Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">
      2A 
    </xref>). Over-expression of RASSF1C did not inhibit cell proliferation. Instead, it consistently resulted in a small but reproducibly and statistically significant increase in cell proliferation of Hs578T, MDA-MB231, and T47D cells stably transduced with MLV-HA-RASSF1C (1C) compared to an empty MLV-backbone (BB) as demonstrated by <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine cell proliferation assays (Figure

   <h3>Identification of novel RASSF1C target genes</h3> 
   <p>The observed increase in cell number in breast cancer cells over-expressing RASSF1C predicted that over-expression of RASSF1C might either down-regulate the expression of cell growth inhibiting/pro-apoptotic genes or up-regulate the expression of cell growth promoting/anti-apoptotic genes. Affymetrix-microarray analysis was performed using T47D cells over-expressing RASSF1C to answer this question. The control sample was RNA from T47D cells stably transduced with MLV-backbone (T47D-BB) and the experimental sample was RNA from T47D cells stably transduced with MLV-RASSF1C (T47D-1C). Prior to RNA isolation, T47D-BB and T47D-1C cells were treated with 1 ?g/ml doxycycline for 48 hr. Data analysis was performed using the dChip program [

   <h3>RASSF1C over-expression enhances breast cancer cells invasion/migration in vitro</h3> 
   <p>Because RASSF1C over-expression up-regulates the expression of CXCR4, a key metastasis gene, we carried out an 
    <italic>
      in vitro 
    </italic>invasion assay to determine if T47D cells over-expressing RASSF1C and grown in the presence of SDF-1 (the ligand for the CXCR4 receptor) were more invasive than control cells. For the invasion assays, T47D cells over-expressing RASSF1C were co-cultured with the human stromal cell line Hs27a, which secretes SDF-1, or were grown in conditioned serum-free medium containing SDF-I. Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">
      4A 
    </xref> shows that T47D-1C were significantly more invasive than the T47D-BB control cells. Interestingly, silencing of RASSF1C in T47D cells using lentiviral shRNA transduction particles significantly reduces T47D cell invasion/migration compared to cells infected with lentiviral shRNA control transduction particles (Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">
      4B 
    </xref>), further supporting that RASSF1C may promote breast cancer cell invasion/migration.</p>

       (A) The BD BioCoatTM MatrigelTM Invasion Chamber was used to assess cell invasion/migration of T47D cells stably transduced with empty MLV-backbone (T47D-BB) or MLV-HA-RASSF1C (T47D-1C) 
     </bold>. T47D-1C or T47D-BB cells treated with doxycycline at 1ug/ml were co-incubated with Hs27a human stromal cells. Hs27a cells express the stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), the ligand for the CXCR4 receptor. After 24 hr incubation period the lower sides of the filters were fixed and stained and cells in four microscopic fields were counted. The average cell number count was plotted. T47D cells over-expression RASSF1C showed a higher number of cells invading the Matrigel chamber and migrating to the other side of the filter compared to T47D-cells, p &lt;0.003. (B) T47D-lenti-shRNA control (Mission, Sigma), T47D-lenti-shRNA to silence RASSF1C (T47D-siRNA-1C) (Mission, Sigma), and T47D-1C cells were incubated with either non-conditioned serum-free medium or SDF-1-conditioned serum-free medium for 24 hr. Lower number T47D-siRNA-1C cells invaded the Matrigel chamber and migrating to the other side of the filter compared to T47D-siRNA control. (C) MDA-MB231-BB (MDA-BB) and MDA-MB231-1C (MDA-1C) cells were plated in the chamber inserts and placed in wells containing either non-conditioned serum-free medium or SDF-1-conditioned serum-free medium, and incubated for 24 hr. MDA-1C cells showed a higher number of cells invading the Matrigel chamber and migrating to the other side of the filter compared to MDA-BB cells, p &lt; 0.001. The data suggests a potential role for RASSF1C in cancer cell metastasis, perhaps through the up-regulation of CXCR gene expression.</p> 
    <graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-10-562-4"></graphic> 
   </fig> 
   <p>In addition to T47D cells, we also show that MDA-MB231 cells over-expressing RASSF1C were more invasive than the control cells (Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">
      4C 
    </xref>). All together, our novel findings suggest that RASSF1C may promote breast cancer cell invasion/migration perhaps in part through the up-regulation of the expression of the CXCR4 gene.</p>

   <h3>RASSF1C over-expression attenuates apoptotic sensitivity in breast cancer cells</h3> 
   <p>Etoposide is a chemotherapy agent that is known to induce apoptosis through activation of caspase 3. Since over-expression of RASSF1C down-regulates caspase 3 expression, we hypothesized that over-expression of RASSF1C would reduce the amount of active caspase 3 that is induced by etoposide. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the amount of caspase 3 produced in response to etoposide by T47D breast cancer cells that either over-express or normally express RASSF1C. RASSF1C over-expressing cells (T47D-1C) exhibit reduced caspase 3 activity compared to cells that do not over-express RASSF1C (T47D-BB) when treated with etoposide (Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">
      5 
    </xref>). To further show that prolonged over-expression of RASSF1C does not promote apoptosis in breast cancer cells, DNA fragmentation analysis was carried out using genomic DNA isolated from breast cancer cells treated with 1 ?g/ml doxycycline for 14 days. Over-expression of RASSF1C did not induce DNA fragmentation in breast cancer cells (Figure 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">
      6 
    </xref>). These findings further support our hypothesis that RASSF1C plays a role in promoting breast cancer cell growth, and it may allow cancer cells to evade killing by chemotherapy agents.</p>

       Caspase 3 activity was measured in T47D cells stably transduced with MLV-HA-RASSF1C (T47D-RASSF1C) 
     </bold>. The T47D cells treated with doxycycline (D) and/or 45 um/ml etoposide (E) for 48 hr. Cells were subsequently assayed for caspase 3 activity. RASSF1C over-expression down regulates the expression of caspase 3 and hence less caspase 3 activity is observed in T47D-1C cells treated with both D and E compared to cells treated with E alone (p &lt; 0.01). Data normalized to T47D cells that were treated with vehicle and the assay was carried at least three independent times with N = 4.</p>

     </bold>. Genomic DNA was isolated for DNA fragmentation analysis using Apoptotic DNA ladder (ADL) kit. It is clear that DNA fragmentation did not occur in all the three cell lines tested suggesting that RASSF1C over-expression does not induce apoptosis.</p>

   </xref>]. Recently, RASSF1C has been shown to interact with DAXX, a protein involved in apoptosis and transcriptional repression. It has been suggested that RASSF1C may contribute to the activation of Stress-Activated Protein-kinase/c-jun N-terminal kinase [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
     17 
   </xref>]. In contrast, we recently demonstrated that RASSF1C promotes lung cancer cell proliferation [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
     19 
   </xref>]. We previously showed that RASSF1C plays a role in promoting osteoblast cell proliferation through interaction with Insulin like Growth Factor Binding protein (IGFBP)-5 [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
     18 
   </xref>]. Consistent with our hypothesis, another group has recently shown that RASSF1C interacts with ?TrCP (the receptor subunit of the SCF<sup>?TrCP </sup>ubiquitin ligase that recruits signaling proteins and cell cycle regulators for proteosomal degradation) [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">
     41 
   </xref>]. Through this mechanism RASSF1C over-expression in the human lung cancer cell line A549 promotes the accumulation ?-catenin, an oncogene and a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to increased transcriptional activation and cell proliferation [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">
     41 
   </xref>].</p> 
  <p>In this study, we demonstrated that reduction of RASSF1C mRNA in breast cancer cells correlated with a small but statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to control cells that express RASSF1C. The reduction in RASSF1C did not affect cell viability as judged by trypan blue staining (data not shown). Overall our results are consistent with those we obtained in osteosarcoma (TE85, MG63, U2) and lung cancer (NCI H1299) cells [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
     18 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
     19 
   </xref>]. In the studies with osteosarcoma cells, the effects of silencing RASSF1C in cells that express both RASSF1A and RASSF1C (TE85) were very similar to those observed in cells that express only RASSF1C (MG63 and U2), clearly indicating that RASSF1A does not modulate the effect of RASSF1C on cell proliferation and survival [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
     18 
   </xref>]. Based on these observations we think that, unlike RASSF1A, RASSF1C is not a tumor suppressor at least in breast, bone, and lung. Instead, it may function as a growth-stimulating factor.</p> 
  <p>To further determine the effect(s) of RASSF1C on breast cancer cell proliferation, we used a tetracycline-regulated MLV-based vector to stably over-express RASSF1C in MDA-MB231 and T47D. Tetracycline-regulated over-expression of RASSF1C did not inhibit cell proliferation. In fact, over-expression of RASSF1C caused reproducible and statistically significant increase in cell proliferation, further suggesting that RASSF1C is not a growth suppressor gene. In support of this, we have found that expression of RASSF1C is elevated in breast cancer cell lines compared to primary mammary epithelial cells, consistent with our hypothesis that RASSF1C may act as a potential growth and survival factor in breast cancer.</p> 
  <p>As mentioned above, a recent study suggested that regulated over-expression of RASSF1C may inhibit the growth of prostate cancer (LNCaP) and renal cell carcinoma (KRC/Y) cells [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
     15 
   </xref>]. However, we have now shown that RASSF1C over-expression does not inhibit cell growth but rather significantly increases proliferation of osteosarcoma [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
     18 
   </xref>], lung cancer [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
     19 
   </xref>], and breast cancer (this study) cells. The different findings related to the stimulatory function of RASSF1C in human osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer cells [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">

     15 
   </xref>- 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
     17 
   </xref>] may be due to tissue-specific actions of RASSF1C. It is well known that some proteins such as IGFBP-5 and FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad) exert opposite effects in different tissues [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">
     42 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">
     43 
   </xref>]. Our silencing and over-expression studies of RASSF1C underscores a potential growth promoting function at least in breast, lung, and osteosarcoma cell lines.</p> 
  <p>To begin to address the effect of RASSF1C on cellular growth, we carried out a microarray study to identify novel RASSF1C target genes. We found that RASSF1C over-expression interestingly modulated the expression of a number of genes that are involved in cancer development, cell growth/proliferation, cell cycle, cell death, and apoptosis. We validated the expression of several RASSF1C target genes by QRT-PCR and have also validated the expression of caspase 3, CXCR4, GHR, and TGM2 by Western blot analysis. We also found that cancer cells over-expressing RASSF1C exhibited increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 compared to control cells (but no increase in total ERK1/2 levels), suggesting that RASSF1C may exert its activities in part through the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. We also show that breast cancer cells over-expressing RASSF1C showed enhanced invasion/migration, while cells with knockdown of RASSF1C expression had reduced invasion/migration compared to control cells.</p> 
  <p>In addition, we found that RASSF1C over-expressing cells exhibited reduced caspase 3 activity compared to control cells when treated with etoposide. We also found that over-expressing RASSF1C for 14 days did not induce apoptosis as judged by lack of DNA fragmentation in Hs578T, MDA-MB231 and T47D cells, further suggesting that RASSF1C does not promote apoptosis. Taken together, the findings are consistent with our hypothesis that RASSF1C may potentially function as a metastasis promoting and apoptosis attenuating protein in breast cancer cells perhaps through the modulation of the CXCR4 and caspase 3 gene expression, respectively.</p> 
  <p>Our findings, together with others', are building a case that RASSF1C and RASSF1A have opposing, antagonistic functions at least in breast, lung, and bone cancer cells. For instance, it has been reported that RASSF1A inhibits lung cancer cell migration and promotes cell adhesion [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">
     44 
   </xref>]. RASSF1A has also been shown to activate the pro-apoptotic Bax1 gene [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">
     45 
   </xref>] which is consistent with its tumor suppressing activities. In this study, we have shown that RASSF1C promotes cell migration and down-regulates pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax, caspase 3, and SRPX. RASSF1C over-expression also up-regulates the expression of inhibitor of differentiation (Id2), which has been shown to be down-regulated by RASSF1A in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">
     46 
   </xref>]. Also, RASSF1C down-regulates TGM2 gene expression, which is up-regulated by RASSF1A in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">
     47 
   </xref>]. Lastly, our RASSF1C studies in breast cancer, lung cancer, and osteosarcoma cells, as well as other reports in the literature [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">
     41 
   </xref>] also suggest that RASSF1C functions in an opposing manner to that of RASSF1A. In all of these studies, RASSF1C appears to stimulate cell growth, while RASSF1A is well established to suppress it. Thus, a fine balance of RASSF1A and RASSF1C isoform expression may be critical in determining the neoplastic potential of a cell.</p> 
  <p>As mentioned above microarray analyses of mRNA in cells subjected to forced expression of RASSF1C stimulates expression and silencing of RASSF1C reduces expression of genes that are associated with cell growth and proliferation. These data provide significant information to propose testable models to explain how RASSF1C exerts it growth promoting activities in breast cancer. For example, up-regulation of CXCR4 by RASSF1C is an interesting discovery suggesting the hypothesis that RASSF1C may play a role in promoting breast cancer metastasis as mentioned above. Recent studies have shown that CXCR4 expression is increased early in the transition from normal to transformed breast epithelium [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">
     48 
   </xref>]. CXCR4 is a signaling receptor that interacts with a cognate ligand (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) that is expressed at higher levels in tissues that attract breast cancer cells and support metastasis (e.g., bone, liver, lung). CXCR4 interaction with SDF-1 activates PI3K and Erk1/2 pathways and promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis [ 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">
     48 
   </xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">
     49 
   </xref>]. In light of these findings we are proposing a testable model of RASSF1C action (see Figure 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">
     7 
   </xref>) based on the hypothesis that RASSF1C increases the expression of CXCR4 in pre-malignant/malignant breast epithelial cells, thus supporting successful seeding and metastases in sites that express high levels of SDF-1. We plan to test this model and others to delineate the molecular mechanism/pathway(s) through which RASSF1C exerts its growth promoting effects on breast cancer cells using both

   </italic>and

     in vivo

  </fig> 
  <p>In conclusion, together with our previous work on RASSF1C in osteosarcoma and lung cancer cells, our present findings in breast cancer cells provide further evidence that RASSF1C is not a tumor suppressor and instead it may promote metastasis and survival of cancer cells. Our studies further suggest that RASSF1C may accomplish this by up-regulation of specific growth promoting genes and down-regulation of specific pro-apoptotic genes.</p>
