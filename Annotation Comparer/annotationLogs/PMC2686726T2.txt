Score: 46.99705512936087 Sentence: They found that amphiregulin and epiregulin expression influenced RR and OS in patients with KRAS WT tumors, but not in patients with KRAS MT tumors, and concluded that the combined use of these markers may allow improved prediction of outcome to cetuximab plus irinotecan
Score: 47.351219204138026 Sentence: In the 10 studies that reported objective tumor response to cetuximab-containing therapy, the median RR in patients with KRAS WT tumors was 35% (range 12% ? 42%) compared with 0% (range 0% ? 6%) in patients with KRAS MT tumors
