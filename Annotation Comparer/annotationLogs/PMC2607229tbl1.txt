Score: 31.513370231264595 Sentence: In addition, there were significant correlations between KRAS/BRA F mutations and pathological grade ( P =0.004), and histological subtype ( P =0.014)
Score: 31.865261434219743 Sentence: The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients included in this study are summarised in Table 1 
Score: 32.582763995513474 Sentence: Somatic mutations of either KRAS or BRAF were identified in 12 (20.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas
Score: 35.677525411220664 Sentence: We found that CI-1040 significantly reduced cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in cell lines with either KRAS or BRAF mutations in comparison with cell lines with wild-type sequences ( Figure 6 , Supplementary Figure 1 )
Score: 36.32854604319924 Sentence: In this study, 8 out of 9 KRAS/BRAF mutations were identified in early stage (stage I, II) tumours
Score: 36.87926606966758 Sentence: Positive active p-ERK1/2 was identified in 27 (46.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas
Score: 38.81115851341747 Sentence: Therefore, we analysed p-ERK1/2 expression in each of the cell lines listed in Figure 5 
Score: 40.60955369734089 Sentence: Exon 1 of KRAS and exon 15 of BRAF were both sequenced, as these mutational hot spots together harbour nearly all published mutations ( Davies et al , 2002 ; Singer et al , 2002 , 2003 ; Sieben et al , 2004 )
Score: 40.92092530226667 Sentence: There was no significant relationship between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma ( P =0.2460, P =0.9339, respectively)
Score: 46.56260823586766 Sentence: The results in Table 2 show that KRAS/BRAF mutation is correlated significantly with FIGO stage I, II ( P <0.001), and p-ERK1/2 ( P <0.001)
Score: 49.854569092170514 Sentence: As shown in Figure 5 , four of the tumours harbouring either KRAS or BRAF mutations showed a marked reduction (<50% of DMSO control) in the cell number in the CI-1040-treated group as compared with the other 14 tumours containing wild-type KRAS and BRAF ( P <0.001)
Score: 51.29643821277328 Sentence: The relationships between KRAS/BRAF mutations and clinicopathological factors, including p-ERK1/2 expression are shown in Table 2 
Score: 52.34233259191086 Sentence: This difference may be because of a higher percentage of early-stage ovarian cancers and endometrioid and mucinous histology tumours being included in this study as compared with the earlier study
Score: 61.21201509873996 Sentence: In this study, we also showed that the ERK?MAPK pathway was activated in 15 (33.3%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas and activation depended on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF 
Score: 68.36268984223406 Sentence: The mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in all 45 ovarian carcinomas is summarised in Table 1 
Score: 105.71849330659269 Sentence: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 58 ovarian cancers, including 27 serous carcinomas, 20 mucinous carcinomas, and 11 endometrioid carcinomas were used in this study
