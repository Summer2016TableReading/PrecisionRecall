Score: 40.50861178718958 Sentence: E-Cadherin promoter methylation was prevalent in the right colon (univariate analysis P =0.011; multivariate analysis P =0.007), so that coincidental K-Ras mutations and E-Cadherin methylation frequently occurred in proximal (27%) rather than left colon (5%) and rectum (8%) ( P <0.001)
Score: 46.22376085582795 Sentence: A coincidental abnormal SSCP migratory pattern and p53 nuclear immunoreactivity was documented in 65 (32%) out of 202 cases
Score: 62.383796991271424 Sentence: The mutational status of K-Ras , B-Raf and p53 in 202 cases of CRC is shown in Table 2a
