Score: 32.73064913746768 Sentence: Moreover, the same K12- ras mutation was significantly associated with increased resistance to the therapy (Table 3 )
Score: 32.80823782237329 Sentence: A correlation matrix using the values of the four variables in MGUS or MM groups only resulted significant for VEGF vs b FGF (r = 0.37, p = 0.002) in MGUS patients
Score: 33.85476567675926 Sentence: The response was defined as minor response when the serum M-protein had decreased by > 25% but < 50% or the urinary BJ had decreased by >50% but not to < 0.2 g in 24 h
Score: 35.46913478042145 Sentence: When K12- ras mutation and the levels of the 3 cytokines under or above cut offs were combined, no significant differences were found in the different subgroups (data not shown)
Score: 35.53533756550768 Sentence: The median serum levels and ranges of three cytokine: IGF-I, bFGF and VEGF, compared with those of healthy controls were reported in Table 2 
Score: 37.41650093949245 Sentence: Two representative examples are shown in Figure 1 Serial measurements of IGF-1 and serum M-Protein (s-MP) from diagnosis (0) to last follow-up before death in two MM patients 
Score: 39.533135048135776 Sentence: The non response group was defined by serum M-protein levels that had decreased to < 25% or by urine BJ protein levels that had decreased to < 50% of initial levels
Score: 39.61468052051969 Sentence: No statistically significant differences between K- ras gene status and serum factor concentrations were found for IGF-I or VEGF
Score: 42.16771559546325 Sentence: Since it is known that gene alterations may be linked with cytokine modulation, we analyzed the incidence (%) of K- ras mutations in MGUS and MM subjects, due to the emerging role of this gene in plasma cell dyscrasia pathogenesis [ 29 , 30 ]
Score: 43.514185309145034 Sentence: MGUS vs MM: p = 0.0001 (*) according to the Durie & Salmon criteria [ 26 ]
Score: 44.77344409461027 Sentence: MGUS vs MM: p = 0.11; MGUS vs CTR: p = 0.005; MM vs CTR: p = 0.0001; Gender: MGUS vs MM: p = 0.30; MGUS vs CTR: p = 0.91; MM vs CTR: p = 0.21
Score: 46.05302535819935 Sentence: In an attempt to find a link between the response to therapy (yes/not), K- ras gene status (mutant/wild type) and the cytokine level (greater or lower than cut-off), we could only confirm the strong influence of K- ras gene status rather than the level of the four different cytokines in determining the therapy response of MM patients (data not shown)
Score: 51.61418734354789 Sentence: Interestingly, significant increases (P = 0.02) of serum bFGF levels were observed in patients showing K- ras gene mutation (median = 4.6 pg/ml; range = 1.2?19.6 pg/ml) as compared with those in which the gene was in the wild type form (median = 2.2 pg/ml; range = 1.0?20.8 pg/ml)
Score: 80.16705490982874 Sentence: As shown in Table 3 , the presence of K- ras mutations was significantly associated with a lower response to Melphalan as compared with the wild type K- ras subjects (p = 0.015)
Score: 338.3626398112055 Sentence: In fact, it was observed a highly significant (p < 0.0001) difference between the controls and MM or between MGUS and MM, while no significance was found between controls and MGUS groups (p = 0.95) by means of a two by two comparison of the three groups (controls, MGUS and MM) concerning the distribution of K- ras gene mutation, K- ras gene status and response to therapy Statistical significance for K12-ras gene mutation: Control vs MGUS p = 0.95, Control vs MM p = 0.0001, MGUS vs MM p < 0.0001, Positive therapy response: minor response and no change disease (see Methods)
