Score: 14.768880610380076 Sentence: A fourth model, OCIP19, also showed growth inhibition, but this effect did not reach statistical significance, whereas there was no significant growth inhibition in OCIP18
Score: 15.09607843122695 Sentence: Tumour concentrations of NVP-BEZ235 were measured in all of the acute single-dose samples with the exception of OCIP19, where insufficient material was available due to their small size
Score: 17.995225795837065 Sentence: We also failed to show significant anti-angiogenic effects in the orthotopic primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, which is in contrast with other groups who have reported pronounced anti-angiogenic effects by mTor inhibitors used to treat xenografts established from pancreatic cancer cell lines ( Azzariti et al , 2008 ; Manegold et al , 2008 )
Score: 18.268547533408523 Sentence: The establishment of the primary pancreatic cancer xenografts was carried out as previously described ( Ng et al , 2002 ; Yau et al , 2005 )
Score: 18.268547533408523 Sentence: Primary xenografts can be established in immune-deprived mice from the majority of pancreatic cancer resections
Score: 18.268547533408523 Sentence: It is likely that the use of orthotopically grown early passage primary xenografts provides a better prediction of clinical activity, relative to in vivo sensitivity testing based on pancreatic cancer cell lines
Score: 18.268547533408523 Sentence: Nevertheless, the response rate of 3/5 seen in the present study appears greater than that recently reported for other molecular targeted agents in primary pancreatic cancer xenografts ( Rubio-Viqueira et al , 2006 ), suggesting that dual PI3K/mTor inhibitors like NVP-BEZ235 might have useful anticancer effects in pancreatic cancer patients
Score: 18.376909642562918 Sentence: We also observed a decrease in Ser9/21GSK3 ? / ? levels by western blot that followed a similar time course to p-Akt ( Figure 4 ), consistent with inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by NVP-BEZ235 in these models
Score: 18.55281863298878 Sentence: Because the acute effects on PKB/Akt phosphorylation were comparable to those seen with the other primary xenografts, the lack of response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment is likely explained by the activity of additional oncogenic signalling pathways in OCIP18, rather than failure to inhibit the drug target
Score: 19.52755064874221 Sentence: As seen in Figure 2 , the histological features were more complex than those typically seen in xenografts established at the subcutaneous site from cell lines, as has been previously noted ( Rubio-Viqueira et al , 2006 )
Score: 21.64877605876945 Sentence: Cut tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphological assessment, and by immunohistochemistry for relevant protein markers including surface receptor tyrosine kinases and SMAD4 using appropriate primary antibodies
Score: 23.797962819243914 Sentence: Similar to the ELISA data shown in Figure 3 , we observed considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity within the triplicate samples, which to some extent tracked differences in the total protein levels, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1 
Score: 27.73657826956348 Sentence: Overall, the effects of NVP-BEZ235 appear less dramatic in these models relative to those seen in xenograft established from cell lines ( Maira et al , 2008 ; Serra et al , 2008 ), which are typically poorly differentiated and rapidly proliferating
Score: 27.863112332563432 Sentence: Five primary pancreatic cancer xenografts, designated OCIP16, 17, 18, 19, and 21, were used at passage number 4?6 for these experiments
Score: 28.02535052499324 Sentence: There was a trend towards reduced labelling for cyclin D1 in the NVP-BEZ235-treated groups ( Figure 8 ), and this was statistically significant in OCIP17, 19, and 21, whereas in the non-responsive OCIP18 model there was a non-significant increase in cyclin D1 in the NVP-BEZ235-treated animals
Score: 36.09942364343209 Sentence: Codon 12/13 K-ras mutations were determined by gene sequencing
Score: 50.42485457067155 Sentence: The characteristics of the primary xenografts are summarised in Table 1 
Score: 54.476333285995004 Sentence: Immunohistochemical staining for the various growth factor receptors showed prominent surface membrane staining for EGFR in most cases, and variable expression of HER2 (ErbB2), c-Met (HGFR), and IGF-1R, often with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity in staining intensity
Score: 54.79813866658372 Sentence: Histological examination of the H&E sections showed that the primary xenografts were adenocarcinomas with features similar to the original surgical specimens, with the exception of OIP17 that grew as sheets of poorly differentiated cancer cells
