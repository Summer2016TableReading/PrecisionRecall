Score: 46.95962834328866 Sentence: 18 and 20 who received gefitinib before metachronous metastasis developed metastatic tumours, which were either wild type in respect to EGFR mutation status (no
Score: 51.75027497139551 Sentence: pY1173-EGFR immunostaining was mainly membranous and was graded as 0 (<5% positive cells), 1+ (5?19% positive cells), 2+ (20?50% positive cells) and 3+ (>50% positive cells) ( Cortas et al , 2007 )
Score: 52.545211893741566 Sentence: Exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the EGFR and exon 1 of K-RAS were sequentially amplified by two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to direct sequencing

Score: 66.219542286505 Sentence: In this study, we arbitrarily classified EGFR expression status in two subsets; the 2+ or 3+ signals were considered as EGFR overexpression and the 0 or 1+ signals as non-expression ( Koutsopoulos et al , 2007 )
