Score: 17.344577713905302 Sentence: Four BRAF mutations (1%) were found in the tumour set (G465V, N581S, L596R, and T599I) and one of these (N581S) occurred concurrently with LKB1 mutation ( P =0.373)
Score: 17.74957565321786 Sentence: Analysis of LKB1 mutation harbouring NSCLC cell lines (A-427, A549, NCI-H1395, NCI-H1666, NCI-H2122, NCI-H2126, NCI-H23, and NCI-H460) showed that five of the cell lines (63%) had concurrent LKB1 and KRAS mutations, two (25%) had concurrent LKB1 and BRAF mutations, and only one (13%) had neither KRAS nor BRAF mutations
Score: 18.120241379164895 Sentence: We detected 34 LKB1 mutations (11%) in the NSCLC tumour specimens ( Table 1 )
Score: 19.369948951066384 Sentence: Seventy tumours (23% in the whole tumour set, 9% in Caucasian, 34% in Asian specimens) had EGFR kinase domain mutations with only one of them occurring concurrently with an LKB1 mutation ( P =0.002)
Score: 20.676304922312074 Sentence: Twenty-five (17% of specimens) of the LKB1 mutations were detected in NSCLCs collected from patients in the United States, whereas only nine mutations (5% of specimens) were detected in the Korean cohort ( P =0.001) ( Table 1 )
Score: 20.676304922312074 Sentence: In support of this hypothesis, we find that LKB1 mutations are significantly ( P =0.007) more common in smokers than in never or light (?10 pack years) cigarette smokers ( Table 1 )
Score: 21.10812626225406 Sentence: As our findings in NSCLC cell lines suggested concurrency of KRAS or BRAF and mutual exclusiveness of EGFR mutations with LKB1 mutations, we analysed the mutational status of these genes in our primary NSCLC tumour specimens
Score: 21.10812626225406 Sentence: Previous reports ( Sanchez-Cespedes et al , 2002 ; Carretero et al , 2004 ) and Cancer Genome Project by Sanger Institute ( Bamford et al , 2004 ) have extensively characterised LKB1 mutations in NSCLC cell lines with KRAS and BRAF mutations, but LKB1 status of EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines has not been extensively analysed
Score: 24.36896741881352 Sentence: In the present study ?2 out of 3 of LKB1 mutant tumours were KRAS wild type ( Table 3 )
